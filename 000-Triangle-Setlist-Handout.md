## Take Your Burden / After Hours

If the world from you withholds of its silver and its gold

C                                      F              C
And you have to get along with meager fare

C                                     G/G7 
Just remember, in his word, how he feeds the little bird

C                                  F                C     
Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

C                       G7             C   
Leave it there, leave it there

F                        C 
Just take your burden to the Lord oh and leave it there

C                                                 G 
If you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out

C7                                            F                C   
Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

C                       G              C C C G C
Now if your body suffers pain and your health you can't regain

C                        C7                          
And your soul is slowly sinking in despair (take turpentine)

C                          (C7)    G            
The Lord knows the pain you feel, he can save and he can heal

C                           Cadd3:2      F               C7=>C  
Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

      C             G7              C   
Leave it there, leave it there

     F               C  
Just take your burden to the Lord oh and leave it there

  C                                        G G G G G7  
If you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out

  C                                            F                C  
Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

C         C             GGG7G7         CCCGC 
Straight into ## After Hours

      C         A7
If you close the door

 Dm OR F              G7
The night could last forever

       C        A7
Leave the sunshine out

      Dm             G7
And say hello to never

         C                              C7
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun

       F                       Fm
I wish it could happen to me

        C         A7
But if you close the door

     Dm            G7           C
I'd never have to see the day again

      C         A7
If you close the door

      Dm                  G7
The night could last forever

       C          A7
Leave the wine glass out

      Dm               G7
And drink a toast to never

       C                           C7
Oh, someday I know someone will look into my eyes

        F
And say hello

                    Fm
You're my very special one

        C         A7
But if you close the door

     Dm            G7          C       -Bass line to Bridge: C - B - Bb -
I'd never have to see the day again

Bridge:

      Am         E7          Am       E7
Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars

       Am        E7          Am        Am Ab G
And the people on subways and trains

       Dm          A7           Dm         A7
Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed

       F                       G
Oh but people look glow in the dark

Chorus:

           C         A7
And if you close the door

     Dm                  G
The night could last forever

       C        A7
Leave the sunshine out

     Dm           G
And say hello to never

     C                              C7
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun

      F                       Fm
I wish it could happen to me

          C         A7
Cause if you close the door

     Dm            G            C
I'd never have to see the day again

     Dm            G            C       A7
I'd never have to see the day again -once more-

     Dm            G            C
I'd never have to see the day again
