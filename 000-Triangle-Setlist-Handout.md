## Streams of Misty Dew 

### by Shane MacGowan and the Pogues

Last night as I slept

I dreamt I met with Behan

I shook him by the hand and we passed the time of day

When questioned on his views

On the crux of life's philosophies

He had but these few clear and simple words to say

I am going, I am going

Any which way the wind may be blowing

I am going, I am going

Where streams of whiskey are flowing

I have cursed, bled and sworn

Jumped bail and landed up in jail

Life has often tried to stretch me

But the rope always was slack

And now that I've a pile

I'll go down to the Chelsea

I'll walk in on my feet

But I'll leave there on my back

Because I am going, I am going

Any which way the wind may be blowing

I am going, I am going

Where streams of whiskey are flowing

Oh the words that he spoke

Seemed the wisest of philosophies

There's nothing ever gained

By a wet thing called a tear

When the world is too dark

And I need the light inside of me

I'll walk into a bar

And drink fifteen pints of beer


Because I am going, I am going

Any which way the wind may be blowing

I am going, I am going

Where streams of whiskey are flowing


I am going, I am going

Any which way the wind may be blowing

I am going, I am going

Where streams of whiskey are flowing

Where streams of whiskey are flowing

Where streams of whiskey are flowing

###  Streams of Mythic Dew / Misty Dew / Mists and Dew

Last night as I slept

I dreamt I met with Laozi

I shook him by the hand and we passed the time of day

When questioned on his views

On the crux of life's philosophies

He had but these few clear and simple words to say

I am going, I am going

Any which way the wind may be blowing

I am going, I am going

Where streams of mythic dew are flowing

I have cursed, bled and sworn

Jumped bail and landed up in jail

Life has often tried to stretch me

But the rope always was slack

And now that I've a hunch

I'll go down to the Chelsea

I'll walk in on my feet

But I'll leave there free in spirit

 

Because I am going, I am going

Any which way the wind may be blowing

I am going, I am going

Where streams of mythic dew are flowing

Oh the words that he spoke

Seemed the wisest of philosophies

There's nothing ever gained

By a wet thing called a tear

When the world is too dark

And I need the light inside of me

I'll walk by a glade

And commune with fifteen wild grown trees

I am going, I am going

Any which way the wind may be blowing

I am going, I am going

Where streams of mythic dew are flowing

I am going, I am going

Any which way the wind may be blowing

I am going, I am going

Where streams of mythic dew are flowing

Where streams of mythic dew are flowing

Where streams of mythic dew are flowing

## Mama Wants Me Vaxxed

Mother tried to kill me Im a Pharoah
Mother brings me soup, when I lived in a tower.  
Then I tried to es-cape...
Now Mama wants me vaxxed. 
I saw her coming with a needle.  
And then the clock struck 9.
I said, mother whats my crime?
She said...
You Tried to Live. 

##

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans


Way back up in the woods among the evergreens


There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood


Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode


Who never ever learned to read or write so well


But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell


Go, go


Go Johnny, go, go

Go Johnny, go, go

Go Johnny, go, go

Go Johnny, go, go

Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack


Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track


Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade


Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made


The people passing by they would stop and say


"Oh my what that little country boy could play"


Go, go


Go Johnny, go, go


Go Johnny, go, go


Go Johnny, go, go


Go Johnny, go, go


Johnny B. Goode


His mother told him "someday you will be a man


And you will be the leader of a big old band


Many people coming from miles around


To hear you play your music when the sun go down


Maybe someday your name will be in lights


Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"


Go, go

Go Johnny, go


Go, go, go Johnny, go


Go, go, go Johnny, go

Go, go, go Johnny, go


Go


Johnny B. Goode

### You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral C G
### And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk D G




### Another day in June, we'll pick eleven for football
### We're playing for our lives, the referee gives us fuck all
### I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
### Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds



### The lovin' is a mess, what happened to all of the feeling? G D 
### I thought it was for real, babies, rings and fools kneeling 
### And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever  
### So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
### Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart

There's something in my eye, a little midge so beguiling
G                                                 D
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
Am                                                Em 
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
C                                                G
So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
D                                       G
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart

# 8 Amazing Grace

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

It was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
This grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright, shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

B Minor 4222
G 
A Major
D  

Once upon a time D
A few mistakes ago D
I was in your sights A
You got me alone A
You found me B
You found me B
You found me G
I guess you didn't care D
And I guess I liked that D
And when I fell hard A
You took a step back A
Without me B
Without me B
Without me G
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize
The joke is on me, hey
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear
Comes creepin' in
That you never loved me
Or her
Or anyone
Or anything
Yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there)
So shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been
(Ooh) now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
Guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait and switch was a work of art
The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

# Lazy Jane Line Painter

Working the village shop
Putting a poster up
Dreaming of anything
Dreaming of the time when you're free
From all the trouble you're in
In the mud, on your knees
Trying hard not to please
Anyone, all the time
Being a rebel is fine
But you go all the way to being brutal
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the first bus out of town
On the first bus out of town
Let's see your kit for games
All the girls look the same
You are challenging style for running miles
You're running miles in some boy's jumper
Boo to the business world!
You know a girl who's tax free
On her back and making plenty cash
While you are working for the joy of giving
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a girl tonight
And you hope that they will see
And you hope that they will see
You are in two minds
Tossing a coin to decide
Whether you should tell your folks
About a dose of thrush you got
When were licking railings
But you read in a book
That you got free in Boots
There are lotions, there are potions
You can take to hide your shame
From all those prying eyes
Lazy Jane, all the time
Painting lines
You are sleeping at bus stops
Wondering how you got your name
And what you're going to do about it
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
Maybe you will have a girl tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see

C C C Bb Dm

I know every single fence post
Every rock to go around
I've been starin' at the red oak
They will never lay me down



Well, he came from Northern Ireland
Searchin' for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been readin' Revelations
With my bare feet in the river
Well, the readhead son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
'Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been readin' Revelations
With my bare feet in the river
I know every single fence post
Every rock to go around
I've been starin' at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down
The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinkin' 'bout that river
Wonderin' how it turns to blood
I've been sittin' here all mornin'
I was sittin' here all night
There's a Bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right
