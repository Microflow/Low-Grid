FIRST VERSE LOWER?: 

### Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden G D
### You were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardon Am Em
### I took a photograph of you in herbaceous border C C G
### It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees

~O~

### Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set G D
### Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met Am Em   
### You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral C G
### And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk D G
  


### Optional

I thought it was for real, babies, rings and fools kneeling (Babies, rings and fools kneeling) G D
We're playing for our lives, the referee gives us fuck all Am Em
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines C G
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds D G


### Good

There's something in my eye, a little midge so beguiling
G                                                 D
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
Am                                                Em 
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
C                                                G
So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
D                                       G
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart

B Minor 4222
G 
A Major
D  

Once upon a time D
A few mistakes ago D
I was in your sights A
You got me alone A
You found me B
You found me B
You found me G
I guess you didn't care D
And I guess I liked that D
And when I fell hard A
You took a step back A
Without me B
Without me B
Without me G
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize
The joke is on me, hey
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear
Comes creepin' in
That you never loved me
Or her
Or anyone
Or anything
Yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there)
So shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been
(Ooh) now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

## Take Your Burden / After Hours

If the world from you withholds of its silver and its gold

C                                      F              C
And you have to get along with meager fare

C                                     G/G7 
Just remember, in his word, how he feeds the little bird

C                                  F                C     
Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

C                       G7             C   
Leave it there, leave it there

F                        C 
Just take your burden to the Lord oh and leave it there

C                                                 G 
If you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out

Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

C                       G              C C C G C
Now if your body suffers pain and your health you can't regain

C                        C7                          
And your soul is slowly sinking in despair (take turpentine)

C                          (C7)    G            
The Lord knows the pain you feel, he can save and he can heal

C                           Cadd3:2      F               C7=>C  
Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

      C             G7              C   
Leave it there, leave it there

     F               C  
Just take your burden to the Lord oh and leave it there

  C                                        G G G G G7  
If you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out

  C                                            F                C  
Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

Straight into ## After Hours

      C         A7
If you close the door

 Dm OR F              G7
The night could last forever

       C        A7
Leave the sunshine out

      Dm             G7
And say hello to never

         C                              C7
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun

       F                       Fm
I wish it could happen to me

        C         A7
But if you close the door

     Dm            G7           C
I'd never have to see the day again

      C         A7
If you close the door

      Dm                  G7
The night could last forever

       C          A7
Leave the wine glass out

      Dm               G7
And drink a toast to never

       C                           C7
Oh, someday I know someone will look into my eyes

        F
And say hello

                    Fm
You're my very special one

        C         A7
But if you close the door

     Dm            G7          C       -Bass line to Bridge: C - B - Bb -
I'd never have to see the day again

Bridge:

      Am         E7          Am       E7
Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars

       Am        E7          Am        Am Ab G
And the people on subways and trains

       Dm          A7           Dm         A7
Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed

       F                       G
Oh but people look glow in the dark

Chorus:

           C         A7
And if you close the door

     Dm                  G
The night could last forever

       C        A7
Leave the sunshine out

     Dm           G
And say hello to never

     C                              C7
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun

      F                       Fm
I wish it could happen to me

          C         A7
Cause if you close the door

     Dm            G            C
I'd never have to see the day again

     Dm            G            C       A7
I'd never have to see the day again -once more-

     Dm            G            C
I'd never have to see the day again
