If the world from you withholds of its silver and its gold

    C                                      F              C

And you have to get along with meager fare

    C                                     G/G7 

Just remember, in his word, how he feeds the little bird

    C                                  F                C     

Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

    C                       G7             C   

Leave it there, leave it there

    F                        C 

Just take your burden to the Lord oh and leave it there

    C                                                 G 

If you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out

    C7                                            F                C   

Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

    C                       G              C C C G C



Now if your body suffers pain and your health you can't regain

    C                        C7                          

And your soul is slowly sinking in despair (take turpentine)

    C                          (C7)    G            

The Lord knows the pain you feel, he can save and he can heal

    C                           Cadd3:2      F               C7=>C  

Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

          C             G7              C   

Leave it there, leave it there

         F               C  

Just take your burden to the Lord oh and leave it there

      C                                        G G G G G7  

If you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out

      C                                            F                C  

Take your burden to the Lord, leave it there

## Another Sunny Day

## Another Sunny Day (Transpose it -7. Orange and Black Chrome Extension) 

THE HIGH NOTES ARE HARD. Should I sing low or high?

INTRO: Strum hard with pared down G chord. 

~O~

FIRST VERSE LOWER?: 

### Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden G D
### You were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardon Am Em
### I took a photograph of you in herbaceous border C C G
### It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees

~O~

### Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set G D
### Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met Am Em   
### You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral C G
### And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk D G
  


### Optional

I thought it was for real, babies, rings and fools kneeling (Babies, rings and fools kneeling) G D
We're playing for our lives, the referee gives us fuck all Am Em
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines C G
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds D G


### Good

There's something in my eye, a little midge so beguiling
G                                                 D
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
Am                                                Em 
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
C                                                G
So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
D                                       G
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart

# 8 Amazing Grace

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

It was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
This grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright, shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

# Chorus

B Minor 4222
G 
A Major
D  

Once upon a time D
A few mistakes ago D
I was in your sights A
You got me alone A
You found me B
You found me B
You found me G
I guess you didn't care D
And I guess I liked that D
And when I fell hard A
You took a step back A
Without me B
Without me B
Without me G
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize
The joke is on me, hey
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear
Comes creepin' in
That you never loved me
Or her
Or anyone
Or anything
Yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there)
So shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been
(Ooh) now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Working the village shop
Putting a poster up
Dreaming of anything
Dreaming of the time when you're free
From all the trouble you're in
In the mud, on your knees
Trying hard not to please
Anyone, all the time
Being a rebel is fine
But you go all the way to being brutal
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the first bus out of town
On the first bus out of town
Let's see your kit for games
All the girls look the same
You are challenging style for running miles
You're running miles in some boy's jumper
Boo to the business world!
You know a girl who's tax free
On her back and making plenty cash
While you are working for the joy of giving
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a girl tonight
And you hope that they will see
And you hope that they will see
You are in two minds
Tossing a coin to decide
Whether you should tell your folks
About a dose of thrush you got
When were licking railings
But you read in a book
That you got free in Boots
There are lotions, there are potions
You can take to hide your shame
From all those prying eyes
Lazy Jane, all the time
Painting lines
You are sleeping at bus stops
Wondering how you got your name
And what you're going to do about it
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
Maybe you will have a girl tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see
