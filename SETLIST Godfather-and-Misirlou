# Lazy Jane?

Working the village shop
Putting a poster up
Dreaming of anything
Dreaming of the time when you're free
From all the trouble you're in
In the mud, on your knees
Trying hard not to please
Anyone, all the time
Being a rebel is fine
But you go all the way to being brutal
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the first bus out of town
On the first bus out of town
Let's see your kit for games
All the girls look the same
You are challenging style for running miles
You're running miles in some boy's jumper
Boo to the business world!
You know a girl who's tax free
On her back and making plenty cash
While you are working for the joy of giving
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a girl tonight
And you hope that they will see
And you hope that they will see
You are in two minds
Tossing a coin to decide
Whether you should tell your folks
About a dose of thrush you got
When were licking railings
But you read in a book
That you got free in Boots
There are lotions, there are potions
You can take to hide your shame
From all those prying eyes
Lazy Jane, all the time
Painting lines
You are sleeping at bus stops
Wondering how you got your name
And what you're going to do about it
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
Maybe you will have a girl tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see

# Hallelujah (Capo on 2nd or third?)

Verse:
     C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                    Am
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C       G
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Pre-Chorus:
   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em          Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse:
     C                        Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F             G             C        G
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you

Pre-Chorus:
    C 
She tied you
     F       G
To a kitchen chair
    Am     
She broke your throne,
    F
she cut your hair
    G                  Em            Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse 3:
    C              Am
You say I took the name in vain
C            Am
I don't even know the name
    F              G                 C      G
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?

Pre-Chorus:
          C                 F     G
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Am             F
It doesn't matter which you heard
    G           Em          Am
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
Verse 4:
  C               Am
I did my best, it wasn't much
  C                   Am
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     F                 G                    C   G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya

Pre-Chorus:
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     G             Em              Am
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
 
Outro:
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

# Don't Abuse your Power

# Macavity 

Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation (would make a fakir stare)
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there
