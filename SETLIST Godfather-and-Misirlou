Verse:
     C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                    Am
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C       G
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Pre-Chorus:
   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em          Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse:
     C                        Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F             G             C        G
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you

Pre-Chorus:
    C 
She tied you
     F       G
To a kitchen chair
    Am     
She broke your throne,
    F
she cut your hair
    G                  Em            Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse 3:
    C              Am
You say I took the name in vain
C            Am
I don't even know the name
    F              G                 C      G
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?

Pre-Chorus:
          C                 F     G
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Am             F
It doesn't matter which you heard
    G           Em          Am
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
Verse 4:
  C               Am
I did my best, it wasn't much
  C                   Am
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     F                 G                    C   G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya

Pre-Chorus:
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     G             Em              Am
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
 
Outro:
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

# Macavity 

Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation (would make a fakir stare)
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there
