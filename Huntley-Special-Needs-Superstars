Huntley, let's go drinking...
F**k it.

Drop the past.

You're alright man.

Do you like cider?

Or whiskey and lime?

Come drinking in Danshui...

Do you play slide guitar?

Re: Huntley, let's go drinking...
We're gonna form a band.

Special Needs Superstars.

- Brock is on keyboards.
- Casey's on drums. You better be woodshedding, Mr Kool Kid Casey. Drums will be your REDEMPTION.
- Im singing and guitars. Lead guitar. Blazing fast solos.
- Huntley is rhythm guitar. He can't play any solos. Only me.
- Zak used to be backing vox but has since rage-quit cos I made a mildly inappropriate comment about that youtuber girl. That's a shame. Miss you, Zak.
- Nestor is Theremin.
- Lord Rothschild plays double bass, if he wants.

The Dutchman will lug our amps and gear while we smoke Kratom in the tourbus. He doesn't get to play anything. Maybe one washboard solo in the break. But he will be so bad that the audience will turn away in pity and disgust.

- Dan is banned, Have you ever heard him playing Californication? It is Horrifically Bad. Truly horrendous.
