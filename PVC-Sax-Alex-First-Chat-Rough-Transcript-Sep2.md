- But unless his instructions are really specific you'll have to go through 100 pipes, also soprano sax is one of the hardest ones

- Ideally you should start on an alto or tenor

 
- Or even a clarinet
- If the sound holes aren't perfect it just gets even harder
- As a beginner using cheaper equipment, honestly probably not.  Also it will necessarily be more clarinet like anyways cause you'll be using small finger holes, saxes use mechanical covers for larger holes

 
- One of the many parts of that sax sound is that the sound holes are too big to be plugged with a finger so this PvC pipe instrument is probably closer to a clarinet or bassoon anyways

- Yes. its technically a recorder, or bassoon

- Thats cool. I LOVE the bassoon, even more than a sax

- aha, Im starting to get it


- I guess? TBH I'm not 100% sure but I have noticed that clarinet and soprano sax mouthpieces are almost the same
 
- So the difference is mainly in the body material and the hole size

- People are finding that PVC is surprisingly good
 
- Plastic is probably closer to wood than brass

- It actually has a dark, dense, cool, classy sound

- Ancient instrument makers literally didn't have it available
 
- It probably depends on what you're going for.  I would describe that guys instrument as an alto clarinet or a soprano bassoon or something based off of my simple understanding...

- Soprano bassoon. pretty close

- May I ask a couple more sax questions?

- Yeah, it's come a long way.  Kind of disturbing

- Of course!

- BTW, the song happy birthday is in the MIXOLYDIAN scale

- Thats a big happy jazz scale

- As someone though who liked compositions and would always get lazy with the details, I imagine an AI like this might be an asset for me

- What are the best "basic sax beginner vids?"

- If Im playing a PVC bassoon, what are the best exercises?
 
- Well, better sax is the most popular but the best detailed videos are by "sax comprehensive"

- Do you get sharp notes with your mouth?

- Or is there a sharp key?

- I can only do the main note and one octave with my mouth... the real experts can hit like 5 notes with their mouth

- Don't worry about mouthpiece harmonics too start you gotta be able to do the basics first

- Some black guy made a channel, sax comprehensive, it's got super detailed mouth diagrams etc

- Blacks love sax for some reason, maybe it's their lip shape ðŸ¤”

- aha... I get it. Isn't there an exercise where you play a whole song with the mouthpiece?
 
- Yeah if you're some kind of sax god

- so what are the absolute basics?

- major scale

- happy birthday?

- I have gotten my tone to where I like it and can only do like 2 notes on the mouthpiece well
 
- Yeah just pick any easy song you like

- what is the hardest thing?

- Also use a phone tuner and make sure your notes are consistent with each other

- If you are outd tune to begin with that's common.  I could only hold soprano sax embouchure for like 15 minutes when I started and was flat by a whole note

 
The hardest thing is patience which is why I'm concerned that a PVC pipe instrument is not a good start ðŸ˜‰

aha. cool, im noting all this in a document, cheers

I am just fanatically exciting about affordable instruments

 
You have to physically build up your mouth muscles especially with smaller mouthpieces which are harder

ok, smaller = harder, noted

So what kind of mouthpiece should I buy?

At 1-2 months I was in tune but my mouth would fail me at like 20-25 minutes of playing

 
After like 6 months I like tone but it fails after like 40 minutes

wow that is harsher than I thought

 
Depends on the PVC pipe you're using but use the largest one that will fit your setup

So, if I just pick three bluesy notes, and work on tone, is that a good idea?

 
Well actually I'd recommend alto because I had a cheap instrument with a tenor mouthpiece and it sounded bizarre

ok, large mouthpiece is good. noted.

OK, that was my question...

 
It's probably possible for too large compared to the pipe... but soprano is really hard to begin with

what does it sound like at first, like a first day beginner?

Like pig squealing, squeaking, honking?

 
So I'd recommend alto, it's in-between the two

i will prolly go with alto

Honking is definitely a thing yeah

 
You need a ligature too btw

So what do I need to buy in the shop? I dont want to get this wrong

 
Ligature holds the eyes to the mouthpiece.  You wrap your lips around it (check those YouTube videos) and blow so that the Reed vibrates against the mouthpiece.  If it's just the mouthpiece it'll squeak

Large mouthpiece, 2.5 reed... and a ligature?

 
Also mouthpiece, 2 Reed and an alto mouthpiece ligature

so that is three things?

Don't try to learn on 2.5 yourouth won't handle it for more than a few minutes

 
Mouth*

ok, so... 2

1) Beginner large alto mouthpiece. 2) 2 reed. 3) alto ligature.

Honestly I would try to find a cheap used alro somewhere.  Half the notes will have air leaks but you should be able to know if the problem is you or your PVC pipe then...

 
There's no such thing as a large alto, sorry... just alto

I literally don't have the cash

budget instruments are exciting to me.

I will deal with the bumps in the road. don't worry

when I was a kid... my parents told me they couldn't buy me a sax, cos it was 800 pounds

and I was really sad about that

 
Yeah that's a problem... one other idea might be to get an extra pipe with no holes.  If you get a squeak from just the mouthpiece, then some kinda honk from a straight pipe (I have no idea what it'd sound like) then you can compare that to a drilled pipe

So I want to show some kid that he can start for 20 bucks

Even if its super hard

I almost played sax as a kid but then I saw the guy clean it out and it had like a gallon of spit in it and I changed my mind

 
But in hindsight I realized that guy was unusually spitty

haha

spit valves gross me out too

But no spit valve would be even grosser

why should I try with a no hole pvc pipe. As a comparison. I can half see your logic...

What am I aiming for? (PVC is cheap, so I will try what you said)

 
Just so that you have a frame of reference... so much might go wrong with a home made instrument

sure, I get it

 
Like, the no hope pipe might not work well either but more references means better troubleshooting

the luthier I am working with is pretty talented. he's a real hardware genius, TBH

aha, I get it

 
Also is this design one pipe or multiple pipes

So with no holes, you're expecting...? just a honk... OK, I see your logic

One pipe

 
Some kind of low note is my guess

multiple pipe looks lame, is more difficult, and more could go wrong

But like, then you can compare it to how you're plugging the holesnwith your fingers

 
Ya one pipe is probably better

I cued this vid. 2 mins if you have the time. He plays beautifully.

Making & Playing the Mini Sax

I saw one guy lined the holes with glue, so he got a better plug

this conversation is very useful, cheers

He's got a nice metal thing going on there

 
Ttyl!

thanks for all your time today. You gave me a lot to think about, and I avoided some mistakes.
