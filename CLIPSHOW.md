Because those are projections of someone else’s reality, and are not The Anomaly’s reality.

Indifference is ‘key’ to unlocking reality.

The control is like a magnet.

The further away the less direct influence over local spacetime there is.

Like a raindrop in a pool of water.

You have to be in close contact with the anomaly to benefit from the anomaly.

In the Universe you always are supplied with what you need but never are supplied with what you want unless what you need and want are the same then the illusion is created where you believe you are being supplied with what you want.

The Anomaly has an infinite supply of what you need but a finite supply of what you want.
