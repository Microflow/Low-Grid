- Mail Charlie. Hi Charlie. Hope you're well and enjoying the cooler weather. Are you around on Tuesday afternoon? I have a couple of ideas for raising small amounts of money, to get a 300TWD per hour wage. 

I can write them up, and we can try and raise some donations, if you want. 

Or we can just go to the University, or Bali.

Let me know if you have some time.

Best Wishes,

Jake
