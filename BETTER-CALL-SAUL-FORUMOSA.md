Query letter for commerical lien, and death threats.

Dear [SAUL]

I'll make this letter as short as I can.

- I had a friend who borrowed a very small amount of money from me (only 3,000TWD)
- When I tried to get the mail back, he sent several death threats via email. 

I have the emails on gmail. I have his name, phone number, and address. Would you be able to help me take him to court for damages, or 
serve him with some kind of commerial lien?

I'd prefer to go the lien route, if you can help with that. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions, or if you can assist.

Sincerely,

[MY NAME]
