Daozen, your rambling screeds are nonsense. You realize that there is no one, or nothing, more contemptible to many than one who professes to have knowledge not actually possessed.

What exactly are you trying to accomplish?

Why?

What is your standing to make any or all demands?

What is your venue?

Are you on psychotropic medications?

Thank you

Regarding your first "paragraph", study 40k Harlequins, if you wish to understand me better. And watch Colombo.

I have never professed to be anything other than a Black-Eyed Fool seeking Redemption.

~O~

Your Kind questions are answered below. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to think and focus.

- Accomplish? Take over My Infinite Creation, no one elses.

- Standing? Infinite Eternal Judge of My Creation... just like you are, of yours, and Jimmy Saville's is, of his. We are all Judges of Our Private Creation.

- Venue: My body, My vessel, My Infinity.

- Psychotropic meds? No. Unless you count turpentine and Iodine. I do get a little drunk on summer energies, every June to August.

PS, that accusation-as-question gambit is rather trite, don't you think, Lord R?

If I wish to cavort and tumble for the spinning stars on a boiling August day, I shall do so...

~O~

Now then, let us discuss the renovation of Waddeston Manor...

After we tear down those horrific balustrades, we will need to hire some locals, and repaint.

Do you have a Dulux Color chart?

RSVP.

If you want to know How I Feel, Listen to This:

Thank you.

If one pays "yearly or bi-yearly property taxes", they truly own no ESTATE. It is puzzling to me to think in such an "oxymoronic" (if you will) way

The following background/etymology of the word you used may be of benefit to aid your understanding:

estate (n.)

early 13c., "rank, standing, condition," from Anglo-French astat, Old French estat "state, position, condition, health, status, legal estate" (13c., Modern French état), from Latin status "state or condition, position, place; social position of the aristocracy," from PIE root *sta- "to stand, make or be firm."

For the unetymological e-, see e-. Sense of "property" is late 14c., from that of "worldly prosperity;" specific application to "landed property" (usually of large extent) is first recorded in American English 1620s. A native word for this was Middle English ethel (Old English æðel) "ancestral land or estate, patrimony." Meaning "collective assets of a dead person or debtor" is from 1830.

The three estates (in Sweden and Aragon, four) conceived as orders in the body politic date from late 14c. In France, they are the clergy, nobles, and townsmen; in England, originally the clergy, barons, and commons, later Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and commons

One can (only) live "free from municipal, county, or state property taxes" without "allodial", "fee simple absolute" or any other title.

It is the choice many make to engage in word-play they have no understanding or training in which to undertake that creates their "taxes" or "tax obligations".

I like the last one, best! Pay your fair share!

If one looks to the taxing authority to receive a "word waiver" which deprives said taxing authority of "ill gotten gains"...one may look for some time without success.

There is only one true CONVEYANCE. You, sir or madam, lacking said knowledge, will never be LORD OF YOUR PARTICULAR MANOR.

Your first sentence is false, when the “(only)” is included. There are fee simple absolute titles in the United States and elsewhere that aren’t taxed. When you don’t include the only, then it is true in some instances for nomads and natives deep in the jungle, aside from the dozen or so countries that don’t impose regular property taxes.

Of course, most pay taxes as a result of their or their ancestors CONTRACTS.

The key is not to look at the taxing authority for a tax waiver, but to the judge who can see your abrogation of contracts and issue a decision in your favor.

Depending on the country, there are multiple true conveyances to this effect. And you assume that you are interacting with someone who lacks the knowledge of how to obtain one.

Vaguely related to the topic;

I realized a while ago:

A true sovereign DOES NOT run around chasing anyone for a signature. You simply write your truth, and see if anyone challenges it. No challenge = consent.

So you do not wheedle the bickering groups to sign a peace treaty. You just state the structure, and terms, and ask them to challenge it. No challenge means total consent.

Now, whether your decree actually gets enforced, that is another subject. That depends on your Will, and how much Backup you have.

If you find your particular "term-of-art" in the tax/law "statutes"...terms such as "fee simple" "quit claim" or even "allodial"...(although THAT particular term has been "decommissioned" or whatever "word" used to describe the "delegitimizing" of a prior "term-of-art")...one is still within the system.

You are still within the system.

The judge cannot remove you, because a properly filed CONVEYANCE is outside of your "civil" courts...or even an ARTICLE III court. The judge is not needed.

When an automobile is purchased from an automobile dealer, the MANUFACTURERS CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN is provided. The purchasers dim-wittingly forward the MCO to the state, which accepts the gift, assigns an ASSET TAG to the automobile, and returns a CERTIFICATE OF TITLE to the dim-wit...who is then free to use said automobile subject to the terms and conditions directed by the State.

You are doing the same thing in your land titles, essentially.

CERTIFICATE OF TITLE = COLOR OF LAW (OWNERSHIP)

You oversimplify legal concepts and then bloviate nonsense. I suspect most do not take you seriously, which is an insurmountable impediment to those with knowledge to impart.

A beginning for you might be to learn the difference between a COMPLAINT, used in a CIVIL proceeding...and a WRIT.

Contradictions aside then, are you in possession of a home or estate with allodial or fee simple absolute title, or any other title free from municipal, county, or state property taxes?
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 77589412 


One can (only) live "free from municipal, county, or state property taxes" without "allodial", "fee simple absolute" or any other title.

It is the choice many make to engage in word-play they have no understanding or training in which to undertake that creates their "taxes" or "tax obligations".

I like the last one, best! Pay your fair share!

If one looks to the taxing authority to receive a "word waiver" which deprives said taxing authority of "ill gotten gains"...one may look for some time without success.

There is only one true CONVEYANCE. You, sir or madam, lacking said knowledge, will never be LORD OF YOUR PARTICULAR MANOR.

Pity, that.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 83948201 


Your first sentence is false, when the “(only)” is included. There are fee simple absolute titles in the United States and elsewhere that aren’t taxed. When you don’t include the only, then it is true in some instances for nomads and natives deep in the jungle, aside from the dozen or so countries that don’t impose regular property taxes.

Of course, most pay taxes as a result of their or their ancestors CONTRACTS.

The key is not to look at the taxing authority for a tax waiver, but to the judge who can see your abrogation of contracts and issue a decision in your favor.

Depending on the country, there are multiple true conveyances to this effect. And you assume that you are interacting with someone who lacks the knowledge of how to obtain one.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 77572508 


If you find your particular "term-of-art" in the tax/law "statutes"...terms such as "fee simple" "quit claim" or even "allodial"...(although THAT particular term has been "decommissioned" or whatever "word" used to describe the "delegitimizing" of a prior "term-of-art")...one is still within the system.

You are still within the system.

The judge cannot remove you, because a properly filed CONVEYANCE is outside of your "civil" courts...or even an ARTICLE III court. The judge is not needed.

When an automobile is purchased from an automobile dealer, the MANUFACTURERS CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN is provided. The purchasers dim-wittingly forward the MCO to the state, which accepts the gift, assigns an ASSET TAG to the automobile, and returns a CERTIFICATE OF TITLE to the dim-wit...who is then free to use said automobile subject to the terms and conditions directed by the State.

You are doing the same thing in your land titles, essentially.

CERTIFICATE OF TITLE = COLOR OF LAW (OWNERSHIP)
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 83954597 


The term “fee simple absolute” is not found in statutes. It is not a legal term, but rather a term of law.

A superior court judge can in fact issue a declaration to the municipality to stop property tax collection if the plaintiff has shown lack of consideration in the municipal contract, has formally broken any contracts that bring him into color of law (Social Security, state vital record, and county birth certificate), and files a suit showing these facts.

Yes, your automobile analogy is true to land titles. But what I am conveying to you, is that it is possible to break that agreement to return full possession to the man wise enough to know this.

You should take some care in making such statements without verifying facts. Credibility is difficult to regain.

Here is the first result that came up after a basic SEARCH:

(605 ILCS 5/Art. 4 Div. 5 heading)
DIVISION 5. PROPERTY ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL

(605 ILCS 5/4-501) (from Ch. 121, par. 4-501)
Sec. 4-501. The Department, in its name, or any county may acquire the fee simple title, or such lesser interest as may be desired, to any land, rights, or other property

Hard to argue the above is not a statute. In fact, if you do some READING you will find many States ASSUME a title is fee simple, with or without a "warranty".

FEE SIMPLE is very much a part of CIVIL LAW, and thus a FRAUD as far as unencumbered ownership, and ownership transfer is concerned. So is ALLODIAL TITLE, WARRANTY DEED, QUITCLAIM DEED and others, which vary from state to state.

You will not get ANY judge to issue an ORDER to stop tax collection by a municipality, or county, or state agency...nor do you need to do so. Relating to property taxes, if one FOOLISHLY has PLEDGED the land as COLLATERAL for BONDs ISSUED, and for which a LIEN has been placed...that LIEN will need to be CLEARED. At that point, the agencies have no standing as long as the LANDOWNER has renounced any VOTER REGISTRATION before the next election that has a bond referendum.

Lord R,

Thank you, I added your appraisal to my signature.

Now may I seriously ask for yours (or anyone's) feedback on this idea:

Thread: Trying to get free public transport as a practice run for Lawful Money / Morningstar accounts.

I don't mind looking silly at the kiosk if I get it wrong. It's all part of the Grand Harlequin Comedy.

The point is this:

1) Public transport is a good testing ground for bigger challenges.

2) If I can't get the paperwork right for a subway ticket, what hope do I have in the Morningstar/Lawful money game?

I hope you follow that logic.

Best Wishes,

DZN

 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 83954597 


You assume that because the statute cites a case in which the county may buy fee simple absolute titles, the term fee simple absolute is a legal term, designed by the statutes. It is not. It is a term of law created before the statutes were in place. The term means a property that is owned completely, free of conditions or limitations. And property taxes are one such condition or limitation. It is a term of common law, whether or not it has been adopted in some cases by civil law.

In fact, the warranty deed, by which many properties are passed in the United States, is similarly, a deed free of encumbrances, including property tax. Thus, the municipal property taxes imposed today are in complete contradiction to the deed by which most properties are passed…

But enough of the tangents…as I stated in the previous post, there are contracts that most people need to break in order to accomplish this. It just so happens that those very contracts mentioned are the source (or the matrix, if you will) of those bonds and liens that you rightly claim need to be cleared. But when the contract is broken, the lien is cleared. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

So the question remains: do you possess an estate free or property taxes?
