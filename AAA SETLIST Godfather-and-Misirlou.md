To audience... we are trapped in a beautiful mirror. You insist we play well. We insist you let our mistakes go. Music is a high wire act. Tonight, you will see us screw up, play in the wrong key, flub solos, miss notes. ZWhy? Because we're reaching. If you sit through the bad notes.... we might also play something beautiful.

And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever

So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart

Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart

# Lazy Jane?

Working the village shop
Putting a poster up
Dreaming of anything
Dreaming of the time when you're free
From all the trouble you're in
In the mud, on your knees
Trying hard not to please
Anyone, all the time
Being a rebel is fine
But you go all the way to being brutal
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the first bus out of town
On the first bus out of town
Let's see your kit for games
All the girls look the same
You are challenging style for running miles
You're running miles in some boy's jumper
Boo to the business world!
You know a girl who's tax free
On her back and making plenty cash
While you are working for the joy of giving
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a girl tonight
And you hope that they will see
And you hope that they will see
You are in two minds
Tossing a coin to decide
Whether you should tell your folks
About a dose of thrush you got
When were licking railings
But you read in a book
That you got free in Boots
There are lotions, there are potions
You can take to hide your shame
From all those prying eyes
Lazy Jane, all the time
Painting lines
You are sleeping at bus stops
Wondering how you got your name
And what you're going to do about it
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
Maybe you will have a girl tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

But you don't really care for music, do you?

You saw her bathing on the roof
    F             G             C        G
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you

Pre-Chorus:
    C 
She tied you
     F       G
To a kitchen chair
    Am     
She broke your throne,

she cut your hair

But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?

          C                 F     G
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Am             F
It doesn't matter which you heard
    G           Em          Am
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Verse 4:
  C               Am
I did my best, it wasn't much
  C                   Am
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     F                 G                    C   G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya

Pre-Chorus:
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     G             Em              Am
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

# Don't Abuse your Power

# Macavity 

Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation (would make a fakir stare)
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

## Amazing Grace / Those About to Rock / Leadbelly Lyrics 

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

It was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
This grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright, shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

## Hallelujah

Son said mother don't you grieve and cry, Hallelu, Hallelu
Son said mother don't you grieve and cry!, Hallelu!, Hallelu!
Son said mother don't you grieve and cry
Know your son was born to die
That's when I have that true religion, Hallelu, Hallelu

Then you must have that true religion
True religion then your soul converted
Then you must have that true religion, Hallelu, Hallelu

Then you must have that true religion, Hallelu, Hallelu
Then you must have that true religion!, Hallelu!, Hallelu!
Then you must have that true religion
True religion then your soul converted
Then you will have that true religion, Hallelu!, Hallelu!

Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay. - Simone de Beauvoir
Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay. 
Simone de Beauvoir
It is old age, rather than death, that is to be contrasted with life. Old age is life's parody, whereas death transforms life into a destiny: in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension. Death does away with time. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Society cares for the individual only so far as he is profitable. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Man is defined as a human being and a woman as a female - whenever she behaves as a human being she is said to imitate the male.

Simone de Beauvoir
To catch a husband is an art; to hold him is a job. 
Simone de Beauvoir

In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation. 
Simone de Beauvoir
No one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or scornful, than the man who is anxious about his virility. 
Simone de Beauvoir
To make oneself an object, to make oneself passive, is a very different thing from being a passive object. 
Simone de Beauvoir
In the face of an obstacle which is impossible to overcome, stubbornness is stupid. 
Simone de Beauvoir
When an individual is kept in a situation of inferiority, the fact is that he does become inferior. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Society, being codified by man, decrees that woman is inferior; she can do away with this inferiority only by destroying the male's superiority. 
Simone de Beauvoir
All the idols made by man, however terrifying they may be, are in point of fact subordinate to him, and that is why he will always have it in his power to destroy them. 
Simone de Beauvoir
It is not in giving life but in risking life that man is raised above the animal; that is why superiority has been accorded in humanity not to the sex that brings forth but to that which kills. 
Simone de Beauvoir
One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. 
Simone de Beauvoir
One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with the absolute truth. 
Simone de Beauvoir
I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth - and truth rewarded me. 
Simone de Beauvoir
If you live long enough, you'll see that every victory turns into a defeat. 
Simone de Beauvoir
I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom. - Simone de Beauvoir
I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Retirement may be looked upon either as a prolonged holiday or as a rejection, a being thrown on to the scrap-heap. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Sex pleasure in woman is a kind of magic spell; it demands complete abandon; if words or movements oppose the magic of caresses, the spell is broken. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Buying is a profound pleasure. 
Simone de Beauvoir
The word love has by no means the same sense for both sexes, and this is one cause of the serious misunderstandings that divide them. 
Simone de Beauvoir
What is an adult? A child blown up by age. 
Simone de Beauvoir
I am incapable of conceiving infinity, and yet I do not accept finity. 
Simone de Beauvoir
All oppression creates a state of war. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Defending the truth is not something one does out of a sense of duty or to allay guilt complexes, but is a reward in itself. 
Simone de Beauvoir
This has always been a man's world, and none of the reasons that have been offered in explanation have seemed adequate. 
Simone de Beauvoir
The writer of originality, unless dead, is always shocking, scandalous; novelty disturbs and repels. 
Simone de Beauvoir
The most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women. 
Simone de Beauvoir
Why one man rather than another? It was odd. You find yourself involved with a fellow for life just because he was the one that you met when you were nineteen.

Simone de Beauvoir
