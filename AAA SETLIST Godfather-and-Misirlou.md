### Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden
### G                                      D (up diagonal slight?)
 
### You were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardon
###      Am                                           Em (4: 7-9-7) 

### I took a photograph of you in herbaceous border
###          C                    C          G (pick? Elongate Emperor Pick)

~O~

### Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set
### G                                              D   

### Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met
### Am                                          Em          

### You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral
### C                                              G

### And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk
### D                                              G  


### Optional

I thought it was for real, babies, rings and fools kneeling (Babies, rings and fools kneeling)
G                                                 D
(Pick eleven for football)
We're playing for our lives, the referee gives us fuck all
Am                                                Em 
(Referee giving us fuck all)
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
C                                                G

Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds
D                                       G

### Good

There's something in my eye, a little midge so beguiling
G                                                 D
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
Am                                                Em 
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
C                                                G
So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
D                                       G
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart

# Lazy Jane?

Working the village shop
Putting a poster up
Dreaming of anything
Dreaming of the time when you're free
From all the trouble you're in
In the mud, on your knees
Trying hard not to please
Anyone, all the time
Being a rebel is fine
But you go all the way to being brutal
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the first bus out of town
On the first bus out of town
Let's see your kit for games
All the girls look the same
You are challenging style for running miles
You're running miles in some boy's jumper
Boo to the business world!
You know a girl who's tax free
On her back and making plenty cash
While you are working for the joy of giving
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a girl tonight
And you hope that they will see
And you hope that they will see
You are in two minds
Tossing a coin to decide
Whether you should tell your folks
About a dose of thrush you got
When were licking railings
But you read in a book
That you got free in Boots
There are lotions, there are potions
You can take to hide your shame
From all those prying eyes
Lazy Jane, all the time
Painting lines
You are sleeping at bus stops
Wondering how you got your name
And what you're going to do about it
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
Maybe you will have a girl tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see

#### Verse:
     C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                    Am
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C       G
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Pre-Chorus:
   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em          Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse:
     C                        Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F             G             C        G
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you

Pre-Chorus:
    C 
She tied you
     F       G
To a kitchen chair
    Am     
She broke your throne,
    F
she cut your hair
    G                  Em            Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse 3:
    C              Am
You say I took the name in vain
C            Am
I don't even know the name
    F              G                 C      G
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?

Pre-Chorus:
          C                 F     G
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Am             F
It doesn't matter which you heard
    G           Em          Am
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C - G - C - C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
Verse 4:
  C               Am
I did my best, it wasn't much
  C                   Am
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     F                 G                    C   G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya

Pre-Chorus:
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     G             Em              Am
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
 
Outro:
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

# Misc

# Don't Abuse your Power

# Macavity 

Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation (would make a fakir stare)
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

## Amazing Grace / Those About to Rock / Leadbelly Lyrics 

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

It was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
This grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright, shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

## Hallelujah

Son said mother don't you grieve and cry, Hallelu, Hallelu
Son said mother don't you grieve and cry!, Hallelu!, Hallelu!
Son said mother don't you grieve and cry
Know your son was born to die
That's when I have that true religion, Hallelu, Hallelu

Then you must have that true religion
True religion then your soul converted
Then you must have that true religion, Hallelu, Hallelu

Then you must have that true religion, Hallelu, Hallelu
Then you must have that true religion!, Hallelu!, Hallelu!
Then you must have that true religion
True religion then your soul converted
Then you will have that true religion, Hallelu!, Hallelu!
