Re: This thread: for Legal Challenges, Affidavits, Death Matches, and Declarations of War
Lord R,

Thank you, I added your appraisal to my signature.

Now may I seriously ask for yours (or anyone's) feedback on this idea:

Thread: Trying to get free public transport as a practice run for Lawful Money / Morningstar accounts.

I don't mind looking silly at the kiosk if I get it wrong. It's all part of the Grand Harlequin Comedy.

The point is this:

1) Public transport is a good testing ground for bigger challenges.

2) If I can't get the paperwork right for a subway ticket, what hope do I have in the Morningstar/Lawful money game?

I hope you follow that logic.

Best Wishes,

DZN

Daozen, things really don't work that way. You are wasting your time and energy.

The state gives you tokens, and you give them back. A bridge troll takes a small taste, but otherwise operates as a metronome...back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

Who are you to interfere with the rhythm and measure of the serfs?

token
t&#333;&#8242;k&#601;n
noun

Something serving as an indication, proof, or expression of something else;

a sign.Something that signifies or evidences authority, validity, or identity.

The lawful money game has ended. Now the REAL FUN begins.

If you find your particular "term-of-art" in the tax/law "statutes"...terms such as "fee simple" "quit claim" or even "allodial"...(although THAT particular term has been "decommissioned" or whatever "word" used to describe the "delegitimizing" of a prior "term-of-art")...one is still within the system.

You are still within the system.

The judge cannot remove you, because a properly filed CONVEYANCE is outside of your "civil" courts...or even an ARTICLE III court. The judge is not needed.

When an automobile is purchased from an automobile dealer, the MANUFACTURERS CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN is provided. The purchasers dim-wittingly forward the MCO to the state, which accepts the gift, assigns an ASSET TAG to the automobile, and returns a CERTIFICATE OF TITLE to the dim-wit...who is then free to use said automobile subject to the terms and conditions directed by the State.

You are doing the same thing in your land titles, essentially.

CERTIFICATE OF TITLE = COLOR OF LAW (OWNERSHIP)
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 83954597 


The term “fee simple absolute” is not found in statutes. It is not a legal term, but rather a term of law.

A superior court judge can in fact issue a declaration to the municipality to stop property tax collection if the plaintiff has shown lack of consideration in the municipal contract, has formally broken any contracts that bring him into color of law (Social Security, state vital record, and county birth certificate), and files a suit showing these facts.

Yes, your automobile analogy is true to land titles. But what I am conveying to you, is that it is possible to break that agreement to return full possession to the man wise enough to know this.

You should take some care in making such statements without verifying facts. Credibility is difficult to regain.

Here is the first result that came up after a basic SEARCH:

(605 ILCS 5/Art. 4 Div. 5 heading)
DIVISION 5. PROPERTY ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL

(605 ILCS 5/4-501) (from Ch. 121, par. 4-501)
Sec. 4-501. The Department, in its name, or any county may acquire the fee simple title, or such lesser interest as may be desired, to any land, rights, or other property

Hard to argue the above is not a statute. In fact, if you do some READING you will find many States ASSUME a title is fee simple, with or without a "warranty".

FEE SIMPLE is very much a part of CIVIL LAW, and thus a FRAUD as far as unencumbered ownership, and ownership transfer is concerned. So is ALLODIAL TITLE, WARRANTY DEED, QUITCLAIM DEED and others, which vary from state to state.

You will not get ANY judge to issue an ORDER to stop tax collection by a municipality, or county, or state agency...nor do you need to do so. Relating to property taxes, if one FOOLISHLY has PLEDGED the land as COLLATERAL for BONDs ISSUED, and for which a LIEN has been placed...that LIEN will need to be CLEARED. At that point, the agencies have no standing as long as the LANDOWNER has renounced any VOTER REGISTRATION before the next election that has a bond referendum.



YOU are, presumably a MAN, who must HONOR his COMMITMENTS.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 83954597 


You assume that because the statute cites a case in which the county may buy fee simple absolute titles, the term fee simple absolute is a legal term, designed by the statutes. It is not. It is a term of law created before the statutes were in place. The term means a property that is owned completely, free of conditions or limitations. And property taxes are one such condition or limitation. It is a term of common law, whether or not it has been adopted in some cases by civil law.

In fact, the warranty deed, by which many properties are passed in the United States, is similarly, a deed free of encumbrances, including property tax. Thus, the municipal property taxes imposed today are in complete contradiction to the deed by which most properties are passed…

But enough of the tangents…as I stated in the previous post, there are contracts that most people need to break in order to accomplish this. It just so happens that those very contracts mentioned are the source (or the matrix, if you will) of those bonds and liens that you rightly claim need to be cleared. But when the contract is broken, the lien is cleared. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

So the question remains: do you possess an estate free or property taxes?
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 76874798 


You are incorrect in almost all of your assertions. The fact that you are arguing FEE SIMPLE is not part of the legal lexicon is an absurdity. One I have demonstrated to you in "black and white" and will not further address.

Similarly, the other types of "title" are not free and clear ownership in any way shape or form. For example, must you obtain a permit to build a structure? You are bound by the civil book of law when you REGISTER (RECORD) ANY of the TITLES you maintain are "allodial in nature".

You also state, FOOLISHLY, that a LIEN is cleared by breaking a CONTRACT. No, it is not.

CONTRACTS are comprised of offer, acceptance, consideration and performance.

Offer: Democratic government
Acceptance: Voter registration (state) SSN (federal)
Consideration: Municipal services/taxes paid
Performance: Bond issuance

You register to vote. Municipality says "let's build a new school" Voters say OK...Property is pledged as collateral of bond issuance. Land squatter receives a tax bill detailing all the various bonds you will be paying for eternity.

IF you ever figure it out, and I'm going to assume you will not based on the exchange so far, you would need to request a payoff balance for the bond principal remaining on your "parcel". After which you might affect a lawful transfer.

Many have good intentions but do not understand the game. Their misinformation creates problems for others.

Your assertions are, in fact, wholly incorrect. From a lawful perspective, fatally so.

To address a point you raised that I have not previously explained, under contract law OF COURSE the lien remains in operation. It must be paid/extinguished with lawful money, IN FULL, before one truly owns the land in question...and only if properly CONVEYED, which your methods do NOT.

This would be the procedure, generally:

1) Request, and obtain, a certified copy of the pro-rated PRINCIPAL pay off amount for each bond listed on your property tax bill. Usually the ASSESSORS OFFICE or similar.

2) Prepare the appropriate paperwork with a declaration of your tender of lawful money to extinguish the lines placed on the property by the relevant legislature. You should also declare your intention to remove yourself from the voter roll so that no future bonds are placed and direct the Sheriff to notify all relevant agencies and departments. It is critical the Sheriff understands the property in question is no longer "public" but now truly PRIVATE.

3) Presentment varies depending on jurisdiction, but in most cases the Sheriff is the only remaining constitutional officer you can access. All the rest of the ACTORS are COLOR OF LAW, so to speak. Give the lawful money and paperwork to him or her.

There are also requirements to update county and state records, record your lawful CONVEYANCE after rescinding your voter application, publication (in most counties), notify county and state AGENTS, etc.

Lots of other little details that can trip one up...all by design. You have to do EVERYTHING correctly, but the payoff is true ownership and FREEDOM.

And yes, I do own MULTIPLE ESTATES...by the definition as detailed above.

Thank you for your detailed response.

A few questions: I have never seen a bond listed on a property tax bill. It seems that the assessor will not know anything about this…is there another authority who is sure to know? Is the amount necessary for the declaration of lawful tender money usually more than the value of the property? If so, how much more? Did you personally make these changes to your estates, or was it an ancestor? Do you know of any resources that can help with the details of these steps? Was this process worth it, compared to locating to a different country that doesn’t impose property taxes?

I appreciate the time you have given me tonight.

Very interesting...

This is why you laugh out loud at us, correct? Because the mystery is right under our noses, but we don't put the 6-12 months of study in to grab what is rightfully ours. I can sense genuine frustration in your writing sometimes.

Step One is writing the right check, with the right paperwork... correct?

What would be a good way to "test the waters"? Try and withdraw, say 50 pounds of "lawful money" so to speak?

I assume this would not come from my post office account (which only has part-time wages), but from my True Value...

Fascinating it can be done at a Post Office. My intuition was nagging me that it could.

May I ask, the paperwork is fairly simple, once you get it right... correct? One or two sheets of paper, a correctly endorsed check.

Is The Trust held at (or accessible through) a Post Office?

I also understand that no speaking is necessary... no tense conversations... it all comes down to having the paperwork right, correct?

Thank you for your time, most enlightening.

Re: This thread: for Legal Challenges, Affidavits, Death Matches, and Declarations of War
Thank you for your answer regarding the tokens, Lord R. I shall read it more deeply once I finish my paperwork.

~O~

I have a simpler question.

Can the Lawful Money Redemption process take place at a simple Taiwanese post office?

Or is it better to go to a bank?

I assume there are similar mechanisms in Taiwan, correct? And once one understands the process, it can be applied in most nations with a functional banking system.
 Quoting: Daozen 


Daozen, the redemption, by definition, CANNOT take place at a bank. CANNOT.

A Post office MAY, if the request is appropriately made. This is true in most, but not all, countries.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 83954597 


Very interesting...

This is why you laugh out loud at us, correct? Because the mystery is right under our noses, but we don't put the 6-12 months of study in to grab what is rightfully ours. I can sense genuine frustration in your writing sometimes.

Step One is writing the right check, with the right paperwork... correct?

What would be a good way to "test the waters"? Try and withdraw, say 50 pounds of "lawful money" so to speak?

I assume this would not come from my post office account (which only has part-time wages), but from my True Value...

Fascinating it can be done at a Post Office. My intuition was nagging me that it could.

May I ask, the paperwork is fairly simple, once you get it right... correct? One or two sheets of paper, a correctly endorsed check.

Is The Trust held at (or accessible through) a Post Office?

I also understand that no speaking is necessary... no tense conversations... it all comes down to having the paperwork right, correct?

Thank you for your time, most enlightening.

The correct post master.

Why would they be more reluctant about Weiss?

OK, You must mean the Keymaster. Like Rick Moranis?

~O~

I guess there will be one officer who understands this, and once someone comes with even vaguely correct paperwork, the case is referred to him.

The cool thing about Taiwan, is they are all polite and amicable.

If I got my paperwork wrong, they'd just send it back, I'd smile, nod, bid them good day, and come back later.

My understanding is most people might need several tries to open sesame, correct?

Can it be done at a local branch, or do you need to go to the Central Post Office?

Hmmm. This is most intriguing.

I'm afraid that went over my head, though I shall turn it over on my afternoon walk by the River.

I love the way the Game Wheels creak forward if you keep putting sustained effort in.

Wish you all the very best.

I hated being King.

I quit and became Emperor instead.

So you're saying its a legit place to play The Game?

I always felt they played fair here.

May I ask, what kind of record did you make? Any hints...

A record of having asked for true money, which the bank then defaulted on?

Is that key?

You go from Debtor to Creditor once you ask for something they don't have, and it's recorded.

Then you go to the next step.

Suffice to say, non un nations like Taiwan, even the Holy See, tend to be in honor law. Weiss manual is a good source of info. Iron clad in many fundamental respects. Yet, legitimacy will always be challenged. I recorded prima facie evidence/proof.

Something special about this island.

It's well known among foreigners and locals, that if you lose your wallet, you'll 99% get it back. You can leave your laptop, instrument, anything... in a cafe, bench, where-ever... and it'll be there when you return, normally.

I presume you mean this manual?

[link to www.1215.org (secure)]

I'm asking myself.. proof of what? A defaulted transaction? You may answer if you wish... but I won't interrogate anyone. You've dropped many clues today, thanks.

~O~

What is their mood when they challenge legitamacy? Moody/sulky/condescending?

I guess the might response might be to smile, say nothing, gesture towards the paperwork, and ask them to challenge it in writing.

They normally try and get you into a verbal conversation, so they can get you on the backfoot, and avoid the rock solid paperwork.

Is the best response to a challenge just to smile and gesture towards the documents?

Anyway, onward.

The Post office info is a massive clue...

Cheers all.
