## Black Heart Star

See Soul/Light is the masculine energy of existence. It seeks out spirit and seeks to impregnate it.

Spirit/Void is the feminine energy of existence, its seeks out Soul energy and seeks to absorb it.

Light/Soul energy is the energy of Assembly and Spirit/Void energy is the clay of life.

At the center of Mother Earth, is her Black Heart Star, this literally Mother Earth's heart, and the spirit consciousness source that generates our matrix reality.

All consciousness flows forth from the spirit consciousness sources that generate the matrix, which you would know as the planets.

Hence why Astrology influences people's personalities.

Those Black Heart Stars at the center of every planet, crave and feed on Soul/Light energy that comes from the Sun.

The Sun shines its light on Earth as much as Earth sucks its Light towards it.

Gravity is the void at the center of the Earth seeking that Light.

Matter is created when Light/Soul consciousness in the form of Protons mix with Spirit/Void consciousness in the form of Electrons.

Because Matter is spirit infused with Light, the Black Heart Star in Earth's core now seeks that Light and pulls it towards itself.

This is why almost all UFOs are always seen as balls of Light. In order to control gravity, you must have enough Light to program that Spirit/Electrons around you thus allowing you to manipulate the spirit with the Light, thus creating repulsion.

The reality you see around you is composed of seven different dimensions of Light, hence why there are 7 colors on the rainbow, 7 musical notes on the scale, and many other things with our reality you will find comes in a set of 7.

There are actually 7 individual sources of gravity at work whenever gravity is taking place, that is because each Light vibration upon the color scale is in effect part of its own dimension that at one point got combined, that's a long story you probably aren't interested in, but you will find there is actually 7 individual gravity interactions going on at once, one of each dimensional frequency level of your perceived reality.

You'll find all the natural functions of our reality including electromagnetism is all part of the quantum entanglement of the binary soul and spirit, light and dark, fire and ice system.

This reality is just what happens as the Light impregnates the Shadow.
