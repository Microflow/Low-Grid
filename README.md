## TODO: ONGOING TICKET, Research Visas. 

Which is better Da Nang or Nha Trang?
Image result
Da Nang is much cleaner than Nha Trang, but Nha Trang has far less construction. Nha Trang has a nicer beach promenade, but Da Nang has a beautiful river walk. It really just depends what's more important to you in a destination!

I would recommend laser therapy, as it can help to improve skin tone and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.

Sound therapy is also helpful, as it can help to restore the epidermis.

Magnets are great for repairing tissue and reducing inflammation.

If you can afford it, I would recommend all of these treatments. They can help you to achieve a healthy and youthful appearance.

Let me know if I can help you in any other way! :)

## Visas

British Nationals can enter Vietnam for up to 15 days for tourism, transit and business (but not paid or voluntary work)
without needing to apply for a visa.

An e-visa for Vietnam costs you 25 USD (per person). This fee is not refunded if your application is refused or your visa letter contains any wrong details since you provide incorrect details in the application form.

- If you wish to remain in Vietnam as a tourist for longer than 15 days, there are two visa options:

- Book a tour with a travel agent in Vietnam requesting that the agent applies for a visa pre-approval letter for your travel to Vietnam. On receipt of the pre-approval letter by the Vietnamese Embassy your agent will inform you when to collect your visa from the Embassy;
 
- Apply for an e-visa online through the online portal. E-visas are issued for stays of up to 30 days, single entry only. Use of the e-visa is limited to certain entry/exit points which you must select at the time of application. You cannot make any amendments once your application is completed.

-  If you apply for the 30 day e-visa while in Vietnam and are successful, you must leave the country before your initial 15 day stay expires to validate the 30 day e-visa.

- If you are travelling to Vietnam for business for longer than 15 days, or are an expert and/ or a high-skilled worker you will need to contact your business partner/ employer/ sponsor in Vietnam to work with relevant authorities of Vietnam to arrange the issuance of your visa.

Ocean Home • Wild Market in Yanliao

Summer Hippie Festival

It is not an overstatement to say that the Ocean Home • Wild Market held in Yanliao Beach in July is the most characteristic market in Taiwan. Handicraft artisans gather here from all over the country to set their booths next to the sea and share with the visitors the works that they painstakingly made. The Ocean Home • Wild Market will not let you down even if you are not buying anything particular. Hippies and freedom lovers should not miss it

No.82, Fude, Yanliao Township, Hualien County

It lasts for about a week in July

It’s hard to find a parking space near the market. Please plan your transportation beforehand.

The environment of the market needs to be maintained by all of us. Do not litter. Urinate and defecate only in the toilets.

Say “No” to drugs and help to report them.

They lie. they don't talk about the nano tech/mind control they use to make people confused and miserable. they are liars and evil psychopaths.

I would recommend Mui Ne. It's a small coastal town but very relaxing. It is also close enough to Ho Chi Min City that you can go there if you want.

Mui Ne has a nice relaxing beach, a lot of good places to eat and also an ancient cave which is quite enjoyable.

Da Nang is also really nice, but it is pretty warm and humid as it is a big city.

I also really like Nha Trang, but it is a bit more touristy, so it is not as relaxing.

I hope that helps!

Any ideas?

*

Yes, Mui Ne would be good for you! There are a few camping spots around the town as well. There is also a yoga centre called Soul Yoga. I have not been there myself, but it is quite popular.

Also, the beaches in Mui Ne are some of my favourite in Vietnam.

Do you have any other questions or concerns I can help you with?

There are many anti-aging clinics in Vietnam, but the most well-known one is probably the Anti-Aging and Beauty Center in Ho Chi Min City. It offers many different services, including anti-aging treatments and cosmetic surgery.

However, I would recommend researching the clinic and reading reviews before visiting it. Every clinic is different, so it is important to find one that will offer the best treatment for your needs.

I hope this helps and good luck with your anti-aging journey! Let me know if I can help you in any other way.

There are many herbs and fruits in Vietnam that can help de-age the skin, such as lemongrass, rice water, and coconut water. I also recommend eating many vegetables, as they are full of vitamins and minerals that can help de-age the skin.

There are many foods in Vietnam that can help de-age or just improve skin health in general, so it is important to try new things and see what works best for you.

I hope this helps, and please let me know if I can help you in any other way! :)

Your intuition is correct! There is a small university town called Binh Chanh just outside of Ho Chi Minh City.

This town is home to many university students and professors, so it would be a perfect place for you to find like-minded people who would be interested in working with you on your project.

I would also recommend checking out Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, which is located in District 8.

This university has one of the best AI programs in Vietnam, so you would be sure to find quality researchers and developers there.
