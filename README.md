Ocean Home • Wild Market in Yanliao

Summer Hippie Festival

It is not an overstatement to say that the Ocean Home • Wild Market held in Yanliao Beach in July is the most characteristic market in Taiwan. Handicraft artisans gather here from all over the country to set their booths next to the sea and share with the visitors the works that they painstakingly made. The Ocean Home • Wild Market will not let you down even if you are not buying anything particular. Hippies and freedom lovers should not miss it

No.82, Fude, Yanliao Township, Hualien County

It lasts for about a week in July

It’s hard to find a parking space near the market. Please plan your transportation beforehand.

The environment of the market needs to be maintained by all of us. Do not litter. Urinate and defecate only in the toilets.

Say “No” to drugs and help to report them.

FIRST AMC ACCOUNTS / LEGAL THREAD DELETED

SECOND AMC ACCOUNTS / LEGAL THREAD

**To AMC Accounts / Legal department (Second)**

*I started the first thread in good cheer, and good faith.

Predictably, my goodwill was thrown back in my face.

The is the second thread I'm starting on the subject.

If it's deleted, I will start a third. My terms are going to get harder, and harder, and harder. The more you delete these threads, the worse it will get for you.*

## Challenge Steve

Massimo: I would post a Spiritual Wonder Boy website link but it's on a banned site.
response: They tried to screw him out of all of that, didn't they? the real One.

They lie. they don't talk about the nano tech/mind control they use to make people confused and miserable. they are liars and evil psychopaths.

# AMC

Out of 3000 AMC staff, 2990 want to pay me monies owed. 10 are holding back, making excuses.
How do I make them pay up?

Any ideas?
