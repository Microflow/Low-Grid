## Visas

British Nationals can enter Vietnam for up to 15 days for tourism, transit and business (but not paid or voluntary work)
without needing to apply for a visa.

An e-visa for Vietnam costs you 25 USD (per person). This fee is not refunded if your application is refused or your visa letter contains any wrong details since you provide incorrect details in the application form.

- If you wish to remain in Vietnam as a tourist for longer than 15 days, there are two visa options:

- Book a tour with a travel agent in Vietnam requesting that the agent applies for a visa pre-approval letter for your travel to Vietnam. On receipt of the pre-approval letter by the Vietnamese Embassy your agent will inform you when to collect your visa from the Embassy;
 
- Apply for an e-visa online through the online portal. E-visas are issued for stays of up to 30 days, single entry only. Use of the e-visa is limited to certain entry/exit points which you must select at the time of application. You cannot make any amendments once your application is completed.

-  If you apply for the 30 day e-visa while in Vietnam and are successful, you must leave the country before your initial 15 day stay expires to validate the 30 day e-visa.

- If you are travelling to Vietnam for business for longer than 15 days, or are an expert and/ or a high-skilled worker you will need to contact your business partner/ employer/ sponsor in Vietnam to work with relevant authorities of Vietnam to arrange the issuance of your visa.

Ocean Home • Wild Market in Yanliao

Summer Hippie Festival

It is not an overstatement to say that the Ocean Home • Wild Market held in Yanliao Beach in July is the most characteristic market in Taiwan. Handicraft artisans gather here from all over the country to set their booths next to the sea and share with the visitors the works that they painstakingly made. The Ocean Home • Wild Market will not let you down even if you are not buying anything particular. Hippies and freedom lovers should not miss it

No.82, Fude, Yanliao Township, Hualien County

It lasts for about a week in July

It’s hard to find a parking space near the market. Please plan your transportation beforehand.

The environment of the market needs to be maintained by all of us. Do not litter. Urinate and defecate only in the toilets.

Say “No” to drugs and help to report them.

SECOND AMC ACCOUNTS / LEGAL THREAD

**To AMC Accounts / Legal department (Second)**

*I started the first thread in good cheer, and good faith.

Predictably, my goodwill was thrown back in my face.

The is the second thread I'm starting on the subject.

If it's deleted, I will start a third. My terms are going to get harder, and harder, and harder. The more you delete these threads, the worse it will get for you.*

## Challenge Steve

Massimo: I would post a Spiritual Wonder Boy website link but it's on a banned site.
response: They tried to screw him out of all of that, didn't they? the real One.

They lie. they don't talk about the nano tech/mind control they use to make people confused and miserable. they are liars and evil psychopaths.

# AMC

Out of 3000 AMC staff, 2990 want to pay me monies owed. 10 are holding back, making excuses.
How do I make them pay up?

Any ideas?
