What Technology is Used?



The needle is guided by the surgeon deep into the patient's brain, in the vicinity of the amygdala. The chip is placed and apparently locks into position via anchors that automatically deploy.

## Severance chip

The Severance chip is the technology at the heart of the Severance Procedure, enabling the spatial separation of memories within its recipient.

An incision is made in the scalp at the crown of the head, allowing the surgeon to drill a quarter-inch hole in the employee's skull so as to insert the chute through which the Severance chip is inserted into the area of the brain close to the amygdala. The patient is awake during the entirety of this painless procedure, but then is sedated, dressed in Severance-compliant clothing if they are not already, and delivered to the Waking Chamber.

Before insertion, the chip comes in sterile packaging similar to a soft contact lens. (Fan prop created by Discord user Bagus_M#4586)
