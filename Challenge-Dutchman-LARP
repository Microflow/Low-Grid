# *Challenge to Stephen Goedhart. Answer these charges within 3 days, or leave the Simulation.*

*I, Daozen, swear the following is true under penalty of perjury.

Mr Goedhart,

This is a privately owned simulation, and you are an unwelcome and parasitic guest.

Numerous insiders, including people I have known for over 12 years, have come forward to express their contempt and disdain for you. You are increasingly isolated from your colleagues, who seem to have had enough of your giggly, self-serving, and manipulative behaviour. This reality is no place for a greedy, spoiled, over-privileged New World Order brat-child.

I personally remember you telling me "You're the star of the show" and "I support the New World Order." - I have written about it on this site many times.

You appear to have very few human qualities. Numerous attempts have been made to reason with you, and all have been in vain.

You have treated this planet as if it is your personal farm and Disneyworld. Everyone deserves better than the awful script you are ramming up their noses.

You have until Friday 6pm to appear here, or respond to jake_snow@tutanota.com. and answer the charges.

This is a privately owned reality, and you are an unwelcome, disliked, parasite.

Your irksome presence here is spoiling the summer. We deserve to have a better Solstice than this.

If you do not answer, this writing becomes the Truth Under Law. Your silence means full acceptance of the charges on all levels.

Appear here by 6pm Friday, Taipei time, or leave here permanently.

Sworn Under Penalty of Perjury, June 21st, Summer Solstice

Daozen*



ANOTHER WARNING.

Stephen,

You have a further 24 hours to apologize, fix your mistakes, and pay up...

Otherwise another round of bullhorning and blackouts may start, and I'll embarrass you in front of your colleagues in the control room. They already think you're a greedy tool.

Lino said you had many enemies, and your time was short.

You can't giggle and grease your way out of this.

24 hours.

Best Wishes,

Your Cash Cow


# AUGUST 24th

Listen, Stephen, you worthless animal.

I know you think you will get away with this. Cos you are such a badass Neu World Order I_did_the_Donkey_Ritual mafioso bloodliner. 

Yeah, your grandfather probably raped a ton of Lemurian kids in Java and Bali. Wow. Well done. Slow clap.

[i]What a distinguished lineage you hail form, Mr Goedhart.[/i]

If I'm incorrect, I will withdraw that accusation. But My seeing tells me it's true. If it's untrue, tell the world under penalty of perjury.

You know the way you were ecstatically happy 2019 to 2021? Brimming full of energy and hope. Giggling in the main office at work. Giggling in the classroom. Giggling on the train on the way home.  

You know what that was, you dumb, dumb motherfucker? 

A lot of that was [b]My GOODWILL.[/b] 

Because we got on... I considered you a "friend" hahaha. And I thought highly of you. So you get a ton of my goodwill energy.

You got cocky. In 18 short months, you have pushed way to hard. So I withdrew my goodwill. This is not a hard concept to understand, you dumbass.

Abraxas Premimum loosh is not for lightweights. You can't handle it. Very few can. You got cocky and now your back's against the wall.

Now. Summer 2022. I can't stand you. 

Cos I don't like you, life is going bad for you. 

For all your esoteric knowledge, you CANNOT understand the concept of goodwill. like. wtf dude? 

Anyway. Yawn.

Pay up the money you owe, or it'll get much, much darker for you. 

[b]Yes, this is a publicly issued threat.[/b]

You dumb, dumb, dumb f**king child.  

The challenge in the OP is still live, BTW. New deadline, August 26th. 

Respond to jake_snow@tutanota.com, or get booted and/or imprisoned even further. 

:hf:
