# *Challenge to Stephen Goedhart. Answer these charges within 3 days, or leave the Simulation.*

*I, Daozen, swear the following is true under penalty of perjury.

Mr Goedhart,

This is a privately owned simulation, and you are an unwelcome and parasitic guest.

Numerous insiders, including people I have known for over 12 years, have come forward to express their contempt and disdain for you. You are increasingly isolated from your colleagues, who seem to have had enough of your giggly, self-serving, and manipulative behaviour. This reality is no place for a greedy, spoiled, over-privileged New World Order brat-child.

I personally remember you telling me "You're the star of the show" and "I support the New World Order." - I have written about it on this site many times.

You appear to have very few human qualities. Numerous attempts have been made to reason with you, and all have been in vain.

You have treated this planet as if it is your personal farm and Disneyworld. Everyone deserves better than the awful script you are ramming up their noses.

You have until Friday 6pm to appear here, or respond to jake_snow@tutanota.com. and answer the charges.

This is a privately owned reality, and you are an unwelcome, disliked, parasite.

Your irksome presence here is spoiling the summer. We deserve to have a better Solstice than this.

If you do not answer, this writing becomes the Truth Under Law. Your silence means full acceptance of the charges on all levels.

Appear here by 6pm Friday, Taipei time, or leave here permanently.

Sworn Under Penalty of Perjury, June 21st, Summer Solstice

Daozen*
