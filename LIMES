The process to make candied fruit appeared during the late Middle Ages, around the 14th century, as a way to preserve fresh fruits. The high sugar content as well as the reduced moisture of candied fruit preserves it from growing mold.

## Can lime juice be fermented?

Once the salt has dissolved into the water, pour it over the limes. Be sure the liquid is completely covering the limes and if any are floating to the surface, push them back down until they stay submerged. Place the lid on your fermenting vessel and let the limes ferment for two weeks.

In a modern context, pickling refers to using vinegar brine to stop the aging process and preserve the food.

Fermenting means a salt brine where we’re encouraging the lacto-bacillus bacteria to grow and create lactic acid which then preserves the food.

## Supplies Needed to Ferment Limes

You don’t need much in order to ferment limes…

**Fermenting Crock (or a wide-mouth mason jar with lid) – ** I use an old-fashioned fermenting vessel with a water-lock system which is great when you need to get in and out of a ferment.
Limes – Whenever possible, and especially when fermenting, it’s best to choose organic limes. They should be washed thoroughly before fermenting to get rid of any pesticide or fungicide residue (especially if non-organic).

**Filtered or Distilled Water – ** do not use city water or water that’s been treated with chlorine or other chemicals because this will inhibit the bacterial growth.
Salt – we use Redmond Real Salt (use code “homesteadingfamily” for 15% off), do not use iodized or regular table salt. The chemicals in those salts will stop the good bacteria from forming in the ferment.

## How to Ferment Limes **

The first thing you need to do when fermenting limes is to sterilize your fermenting vessel. You can do this by simply placing the container in a large pot of water and slowly bringing it up to a boil. Boil the vessel for 12 minutes, remove from water and let air dry.
Make a brine with salt and filtered (or distilled) water. We use a ratio of 2:1 meaning 2 Tablespoons of salt for every 1 quart of water. I’m using 1/2 gallons of water (two quarts) so I’m going to add four tablespoons of my good quality salt.
Let the salt sit for a while and begin to dissolve.
Thoroughly wash your limes and place tightly into your fermenting crock or mason jar. Really pack them in there, but do keep in mind the limes will swell just a bit.
Once the salt has dissolved into the water, pour it over the limes. Be sure the liquid is completely covering the limes and if any are floating to the surface, push them back down until they stay submerged.
Place the lid on your fermenting vessel and let the limes ferment for two weeks.

* If you want to enhance the flavor of your limes you can add herbs or spices to your brine, something like peppercorns or red pepper flakes would give them a bit of a kick. Get creative and do what you’ll enjoy!
