Dear Simulation Participants: You are hereby cordially required to sign the following form...
Dear Simulation Participants,

The May weather continues to delight and confound us in equal turns.

Hope you're enjoying The Great and Secret Show.

Now, on to business.

~O~

We hear persistent rumours about the elite of Earth. As you are aware, many so-called "elites" and EArth citizens are under suspicion of satanic ritual practices, intercourse with minors, and consuming products made from humans.

To put the rumours to rest, you are cordially requested to sign the following statement within 49 hours topside time. That was not a typo! We gave you an extra hour because we're feeling generous. Forms must be completed, across the entire expanse of the simulation, by 4pm, Saturday 14th, Taiwan time.

You may sign Form 22 in the upper realms if you so desire.

Understand that this is neither slander nor libel. We are simply asking you to take one minute to clear your names under the law.

Form follows:
