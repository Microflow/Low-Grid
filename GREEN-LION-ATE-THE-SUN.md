## Green Lion Ate The Sun

Very helpful! This is an important image in the video game Virtue's Last Reward, and I was wondering what the symbolism meant. 
The consciousness thing makes sense within the context of the game - there's a virus 
in the game that causes the victim to experience information overload, prompting strong feelings of suicide.

Green Lion = Cannabis. When cannabis is boiled down to a tincture, it looks like liquid gold with shiny gold flecks within it (gold tincture). 
The bud is always the tail of the lion, often 7 leaf shapes are seen around the beast. The devouring of the sun is cannabis' obvious 
feminising properties, which, when applied will open those 7 seals.

Would it be foolish to equate the seven seals with the chakras?

I have read multiple books on esoteric symbolism and I believe it was Blavatsky who spoke of 
the green lion, the aspirant - green because he is learning and because he must work from the 
heart which is represented as the 4th green chakra. The lion because to endeavor into the arts 
of occult knowledge, into Gods dimensions the aspirant must hold courage and bravery. The lion 
holds no fear. Consuming the sun is the alchemy of God's energy. Of quiet peace and love for 
the soul within you real sunlight is beneficial but the quiet focus on being, your 
breath, on energy flowering through your body. This is the consumption of the sun. Gods energy. 
The painting is a representation of a aspirant working towards becoming an adept. Its beautiful, 
courageous, and a working energy toward God, toward love and for mankind's souls. Its lovely. 
Thank you for posting it.

The green door is on the inside of the gate.

Of course golden gate is a big esoteric symbol.
"The gateway of the Gods" that is direct access to God's throne room.

The heavenly golden gate was blocked when Lucifer fell,
That is why the golden gate bridge is destroyed in dozens of movies. And this blockage 
is part of the "chains of darkness" they fell into.

The golden gate is also in the heavens. Between Scorpio and Sagittarius.

The silver gate is called the gate of man and is the physical gate. Like childbirth

The golden gate is the spiritual gate like entering in through consciousness, prayer.

The bible teaches believers have the mind of Christ.
Being born again belong to heaven and in prayer we are one kind with Christ and our thoughts and prayers 
enter the throne room.

Of course the Catholic church has their "keys to the kingdom" gold and silver keys And they love to think they have hidden knowledge.

That's all I can think of now, bit many already know all this stuff.

Green door only on the inside speaks to entering the kingdom through prayer And being born again inside.

pS, I heard a rumor all ET have joined the arcturian alliance and the galactic federation and stopped 
warring. This would be good for earth.
