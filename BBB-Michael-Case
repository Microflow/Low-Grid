I have a couple of cases I'd like to start this Autumn. I'd prefer to go the commercial law route. That is to say, I'd like to put a lien on someone's property.  

One case is rock solid. The second is harder to prove. 

I have many emails to prove the following case:

I had a local 'friend' who I lent some money to. A tiny amount, 3000TWD. Yes, I know, nothing.  I'd like to come after him for that, and then damages because of multiple death and violence threats. I have a six page document, and literally hundreds of email rants. 

When I asked him to pay the money back, he sent all sorts of weird emails. All of them are stored in gmail.

Including:
