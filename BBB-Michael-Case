I have a couple of cases I'd like to start this Autumn. I'd prefer to go the commercial law route. That is to say, I'd like to put a lien on someone's property.  

One case is rock solid. The second is harder to prove. 

I have many emails to prove the following case:

I had a local 'friend' who I lent some money to. A tiny amount, 3000TWD. Yes, I know, nothing.  I'd like to come after him for that, and then damages because of multiple death and violence threats. I have a six page document, and literally hundreds of email rants. 

When I asked him to pay the money back, he sent all sorts of weird emails. All of them are stored in gmail.

He also admitted he owed me money on emails many times.

Including:

1) 再見面時。就是我看著斷頭臺上行刑。

Zài jiànmiàn shí. Jiùshì wǒ kànzhe duàntóutái shàng xíngxíng.

When we meet again, it's me watching the guillotine perform torture.


2) 你的血可以用來祭拜上帝

Nǐ de xuè kěyǐ yòng lái jì bài shàngdì

Your blood can be used to worship God.


3) 哈哈大笑?!花用你的錢!我花得好爽快。
ㄧ毛都不會給你，哈哈大笑

Hāhā dà xiào?! Huā yòng nǐ de qián! Wǒ huā dé hǎo shuǎngkuài.
Yi1 máo dōu bù huì gěi nǐ, hāhā dà xiào

Haha laughing, I will use your money. Won't give you one Mao. Laughing.
