Re: This thread: for Legal Challenges, Affidavits, Death Matches, and Declarations of War
That's a good doc...

Are we trying to access a trust that has already been set up in our name?

Or are we setting up our own recorded, expressly created trust?

Is there a secret trust with lots of money in it, somehow?

Or is the money spent, and we need to record evidence of default?

And then take out money that THEY OWE US, as legally recorded debtors?

Re: This thread: for Legal Challenges, Affidavits, Death Matches, and Declarations of War
...


You are incorrect in almost all of your assertions. The fact that you are arguing FEE SIMPLE is not part of the legal lexicon is an absurdity. One I have demonstrated to you in "black and white" and will not further address.

Similarly, the other types of "title" are not free and clear ownership in any way shape or form. For example, must you obtain a permit to build a structure? You are bound by the civil book of law when you REGISTER (RECORD) ANY of the TITLES you maintain are "allodial in nature".

You also state, FOOLISHLY, that a LIEN is cleared by breaking a CONTRACT. No, it is not.

CONTRACTS are comprised of offer, acceptance, consideration and performance.

Offer: Democratic government
Acceptance: Voter registration (state) SSN (federal)
Consideration: Municipal services/taxes paid
Performance: Bond issuance

You register to vote. Municipality says "let's build a new school" Voters say OK...Property is pledged as collateral of bond issuance. Land squatter receives a tax bill detailing all the various bonds you will be paying for eternity.

IF you ever figure it out, and I'm going to assume you will not based on the exchange so far, you would need to request a payoff balance for the bond principal remaining on your "parcel". After which you might affect a lawful transfer.

Many have good intentions but do not understand the game. Their misinformation creates problems for others.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 83954597 


I am not arguing that fee simple is not part of the legal lexicon, but rather that it is a term of law created before the statutes and their color of law. That is my distinction: lawful (no color of law) vs. legal (color of law).

Just because the county or town has imposed trivialities like building permits does not mean that these additions are in line with the spirit of the law which superseded them. This is true for property taxes as well. Hence it follows that my assertions are not incorrect, just a different perspective.

When a man or woman breaks a contract he/she is no longer responsible for any lien associated with said contract. That is the point. You make it seem like the contract is necessary to live in the United States of America, when it is not, because the Republic and common law underly the democracy and its civil law.

But assuming you are right, to which authority does one need to go to pay off the bond principal remaining on a parcel?
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 77560986 


Your assertions are, in fact, wholly incorrect. From a lawful perspective, fatally so.

To address a point you raised that I have not previously explained, under contract law OF COURSE the lien remains in operation. It must be paid/extinguished with lawful money, IN FULL, before one truly owns the land in question...and only if properly CONVEYED, which your methods do NOT.

This would be the procedure, generally:

1) Request, and obtain, a certified copy of the pro-rated PRINCIPAL pay off amount for each bond listed on your property tax bill. Usually the ASSESSORS OFFICE or similar.

2) Prepare the appropriate paperwork with a declaration of your tender of lawful money to extinguish the lines placed on the property by the relevant legislature. You should also declare your intention to remove yourself from the voter roll so that no future bonds are placed and direct the Sheriff to notify all relevant agencies and departments. It is critical the Sheriff understands the property in question is no longer "public" but now truly PRIVATE.

3) Presentment varies depending on jurisdiction, but in most cases the Sheriff is the only remaining constitutional officer you can access. All the rest of the ACTORS are COLOR OF LAW, so to speak. Give the lawful money and paperwork to him or her.

There are also requirements to update county and state records, record your lawful CONVEYANCE after rescinding your voter application, publication (in most counties), notify county and state AGENTS, etc.

Lots of other little details that can trip one up...all by design. You have to do EVERYTHING correctly, but the payoff is true ownership and FREEDOM.

And yes, I do own MULTIPLE ESTATES...by the definition as detailed above.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 83954597 


Thank you for your detailed response.

A few questions: I have never seen a bond listed on a property tax bill. It seems that the assessor will not know anything about this…is there another authority who is sure to know? Is the amount necessary for the declaration of lawful tender money usually more than the value of the property? If so, how much more? Did you personally make these changes to your estates, or was it an ancestor? Do you know of any resources that can help with the details of these steps? Was this process worth it, compared to locating to a different country that doesn’t impose property taxes?

I appreciate the time you have given me tonight.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 77560986 


You're welcome. It is refreshing to see some CIVILITY and genteel behavior, as used to be the accepted custom among GENTLEMEN.

You are correct that the actual BOND number (or BOND amount) does not appear specifically on the tax bill...and for a very good reason. The bond payments and current expenses (salaries, administration costs, etc) are rolled together into the total tax figure which is prominently displayed for your puzzlement. Of course, unless you pledged your land, OR OBJECTED, only the bond payment is secured by your land. Hey...can't blame the bureaucrats if no one objects.

You will have to request the bonds (likely several...anything a referendum was submitted to the voters and subsequently approved) PRINCIPAL pro-rated payout balance amount for your land. Rest assured, this amount is well understood and closely tracked. As for the dumb stares you will receive should you go in person, well, consider if you went to your local WALMART and asked the cashier mope for information on corporate bonds walmart may have issued. Would you expect them to understand or respond?

You MUST direct all questions to the appropriate bureaucrat...one that has a DUTY in regards to your line of inquiry. This position may/is different from county to county. Might be the treasurer, might be the assessor. Call around and asks who manages the bond issuances. Someone does. Best way is to do it in WRITING...and PLEASE don't write as Daozen does...keep it SIMPLE and DIRECT.

You might also ask, in the same missive, if the county maintains ANY OTHER equity interest in the property in question. If so, have them enumerate each and every one they so claim, supported by specific law granting such authority.

Regarding the amount of PRINCIPAL payment you might expect, there is, of course, no way to know without requesting. However, perhaps not surprisingly, MOST of the payments made into the property tax system are INTEREST PAYMENTS. When you pay off YOUR principal, the obligation is satisfied and no more interest payments are due. Thus, no property tax payments. Unless one has read the bond TERMS AND CONDITIONS, one is unlikely to know that bonds can be rolled over..principal payments deferred, etc. Many municipalities and corporate governments do this and re-route the funds to other uses.

Always productive, of course.

Finally, YOU are the only AUTHORITY. YOU, per your own COMMENTS, illustrate why you will likely not succeed.There is no checklist to follow...there is only LAW, natural and common to lead you. Many sacrificed ALL to give you what you can TAKE if you have the mettle to live as a FREE MAN.

You speak, and think, like a slave...not a MAN. Take the time to LEARN so you live an AUTHENTIC LIFE. Be able to stand your ground based on knowledge. Be non-confrontational
but do not yield. You will earn your freedom and RESPECT.
Daozen is a FOOL, but, because he OWNS his FOOLISHNESS and actually SEEKS REDEMPTION, is of some mild interest.

Most do not understand the ENORMOUS EFFORT expended on their behalf by those who subjugate.

Think of animal husbandry. Farmers toil to birth and raise livestock, expending not a little effort raising to maturity. Effort and expense are made with no immediate return on CAPITAL.

Of course, the payoff is LATER, when the animal is SLAUGHTERED.

Would said animals be able to live in the wild?

Doubtful.

Once domesticated, the outcome is in question.

We must thus consider the calculus:

Live as cattle/chattel and enjoy all the farmer has to offer...or venture into an unknown world full of dangers and adventures with no guarantee of survival.

Each MAN will ultimately decide...by DEFAULT or OTHERWISE.

Alright, lets go off the deep end.

Has anyone heard of the Player Account that can be redeemed at any ~subway station~.

My contact was adamant this was the case. Yes. Subway/Underground station. We're halfway to Harry Potter banking here.

My contact has no reason to lie.

He told me a few weeks later he was being pressured by both sides.

He told me I'd been declared an 'illegal player' so retrieving my funds would be harder than normal.. but not impossible.

Any comments?

Im kind of enjoying this Treasure Hunt, so lets plod on.

Interesting that they remind you its a treasure hunt in school.

I bet the game Secret of Monkey Island is laden with clues.
