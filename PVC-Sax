# Drill bit hole size from awesome player:


The pipe is 19 1/2 inches long,

The diameter of the pipe is 1 inch, 

There is a 1 1/2 distance from the center of the first top three holes 
so each doubt that you make for your first three holes should be 1 1/2 inch apart. 
Hole 4 should be 1 and 5/8 inches from the 3rd hole, 
the 5th hole should be the same along with the 6th hole. 

Drill bit hole size: 

The first three holes, 1/2 drill bit, 
The fourth hole, 3/8 drillbit 
hole 5 and 6, 1/2 drillbit.
