## LORD RUPERT ELABORATES

Well stated, Daozen!

Well stated, indeed!

However, as inadvertent as your discovery has been, I am honour-bound to elaborate and attempt to enlighten the un-enlightenable.

A Sisyphean existence, to state the OBVIOUS.

You are to be the FIRST RECIPIENT of the newly developed and literally just-now-coined STUMBLEBUM.

The STUMBLEBUM is the digital equivalent of exactly one unit of STUPID LUCK...epitomized in BROMIDES of old:

Even A blind squirrel eventually finds a nut
Monkeys/typewriters...

Etc.

Your STUMBLEBUM requires no energy to create and uses no energy in its redemption. There are no PROOF-OF-WORK or PROOF-OF-STAKE controversies requiring user inputs.

Opinions are NOT welcome, nor necessary.

You, Daozen, have earned a STUMBLEBUM, and HERE IT IS:

Yes, chlorophyll is the SOUL of the plant kingdom.

Distributed, Disseminated, Shared and Resonant.

It is a MISSING PIECE of the Puzzle you seek. However, even knowing this you will fail to grasp what you are being told.

It is the NATURE of your BEASTLY existence.

Free with this introductory STUMBLEBUM is a bonus token we shall refer to as the DERP...Given for outstanding STUPIDITY in the face of KNOWLEDGE.

Take the topic of SOURCE MATERIAL. Are all SOURCE MATERIALS THE SAME resultant factor?

Cannabis is grown throughout the world and possesses myriad and untapped potential. Herewith, we now redeem your DERP token:

Cannabis extraction processes, of which there are many, consider the cannabis leaf chlorophyll to be a CONTAMINANT.

The THC, of course, is much sought after for its distraction from the TRUE PRIZE.

DERP

You have been rewarded for your gallantry and persistence in the face of withering, yet well deserved, criticism and mockery.

The STUMBLEBUM was created, redeemed and authenticated with zero energy inputs and no carbon outputs.

Further, it has enriched the wealth of ALL who bother to move their oculi and engage otherwise unused neurons.

True Egalitarianism!

FINALLY.

DERPines should be studied!

Pity you didn't ask a QUESTION
