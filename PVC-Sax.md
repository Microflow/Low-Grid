## We're bulding a Recorder / Bassoon with a Sax Mouthpiece

As this instrument has no keys, it's technically a recorder. A friend said it was a "soprano bassoon".

We're using the sax mouthiece for a better tone.

We can research "DIY recorders" to understand hole theory.



# Measurements

# Drill bit hole size from the above video.

### NOTE: There are a couple of typos, which I preserved, because I wasn't sure exactly what he was saying..

- The pipe is 19 1/2 inches long,

- The diameter of the pipe is 1 inch, 

- There is a 1 1/2 distance from the center of the first top three holes 
so each doubt that you make for your first three holes should be 1 1/2 inch apart. 

- NOTE: What did he mistype with "doubt"?

- NOTE: FIRST THREE HOLES 1 and 1/2 inch apart.

- Hole 4 should be 1 and 5/8 inches from the 3rd hole, 
the 5th hole should be the same, along with the 6th hole. 

- NOTE: LAST THREE HOLES 1 and 5/8 inches apart?

### Drill bit hole size: 

- The first three holes, 1/2 drill bit, 
- The fourth hole, 3/8 drillbit 
- Hole 5 and 6, 1/2 drillbit.

## Materials: 

- The pipe is made from a piece of PVC 
- The saxophone mouthpiece I bought from a music store
- The rubber cap  holding on the saxophone mouthpiece can be bought from any hardware store
- The copper elbow tubing goes into the saxophone mouthpiece 

## Hole Size Theory

### Yamaha Primer on Hole Measurement Basics.

A little wordy, but good.

*The tone holes of a recorder tend to be thought of as being positioned at regular intervals, but that is not actually the case.
They are not at regular intervals, nor are they all positioned in a straight line. The holes are not in a straight line because they are positioned so as to be easier to cover with the fingers.
In fact, providing they are positioned at the same height in the bore, the same pitch of sound will be produced irrespective of where they are placed on a circumference of the bore at that height. If you try stretching your fingers, you will find that on the human hand, the middle finger and the ring finger are harder to stretch than other fingers. Therefore, for the position of the holes on a recorder, the space between holes covered by the middle finger and the ring finger is also minimized.
In accordance with the closely related pitch of the notes and size of the holes, the locations for all of the holes have been precisely adjusted so as to be easy to cover with the fingers.*
