#### We're bulding a Recorder / Bassoon with a Sax Mouthpiece

As this instrument has no keys, it's technically a recorder. A friend said it was a "soprano bassoon".

We're using the sax mouthiece for a better tone.

We can research "DIY recorders" to understand hole theory.



# Measurements

### Drill bit hole size from the above video.

#### NOTE: There are a couple of typos, which I preserved, because I wasn't sure exactly what he was saying..

- The pipe is 19 1/2 inches long,

- The diameter of the pipe is 1 inch, 

- There is a 1 1/2 distance from the center of the first top three holes 
so each doubt that you make for your first three holes should be 1 1/2 inch apart. 

- NOTE: What did he mistype with "doubt"?

- NOTE: FIRST THREE HOLES 1 and 1/2 inch apart.

- Hole 4 should be 1 and 5/8 inches from the 3rd hole, 
the 5th hole should be the same, along with the 6th hole. 

- NOTE: LAST THREE HOLES 1 and 5/8 inches apart?

### Drill bit hole size: 

- The first three holes, 1/2 drill bit, 
- The fourth hole, 3/8 drillbit 
- Hole 5 and 6, 1/2 drillbit.

## PVC Sax Materials: 

#### From the first vid.

- The pipe is made from a piece of PVC 
- The saxophone mouthpiece I bought from a music store
- The rubber cap  holding on the saxophone mouthpiece can be bought from any hardware store
- **The copper elbow tubing goes into the saxophone mouthpiece.** 

### Hole Size Theory

###### You can finely adjust tone hole size using a knife.

#### Yamaha Primer on Hole Measurement Basics.

A little wordy, but good.

*- The tone holes of a recorder tend to be thought of as being positioned at regular intervals, but that is not actually the case.

- They are not at regular intervals, nor are they all positioned in a straight line. 
- The holes are not in a straight line because they are positioned so as to be easier to cover with the fingers.
- In fact, providing they are positioned at the same height in the bore, the same pitch of sound will be produced irrespective of where they are placed on a circumference of the bore at that height. 
- If you try stretching your fingers, you will find that on the human hand, the middle finger and the ring finger are harder to stretch than other fingers. 
- Therefore, for the position of the holes on a recorder, the space between holes covered by the middle finger and the ring finger is also minimized.
- In accordance with the closely related pitch of the notes and size of the holes, the locations for all of the holes have been precisely adjusted so as to be easy to cover with the fingers.*

** To give an example of the relationship between the positions of the tone holes and their size, if the position of the hole is moved farther down the bore of the recorder, the pitch of the sound can only be preserved by making the hole bigger. Conversely, when the hole is repositioned higher up the bore, it will be designed to be smaller.** 

#### For a wooden recorder, if the pitch is found to be very slightly out during the final tuning, the size of the hole will be finely adjusted using a knife.

### Best Reeds

Whats the best reed for a breathy, dark, blusy sound...?
Thu 10:16 PM
Alexander
Thicker reeds but the mouthpiece effects it a lot too
Alexander
Well, stronger... they aren't always technically thicker
Alexander
They come in strengths but I can't blow anything above a 3 effectively.  A beginner Reed is a 2 and 2.5 is most common
I've also had some success with a 1.5 but only in the lower registers of a soprano, but it has some interesting "spooky" potential
1:16 AM
You sent
2.5 or 1.5, got it. Cheers.
Alexander
For a dark sound 3+
Alexander
1.5 sounds spooky in a way it's a light sound
Alexander
Sound quality will probably suck if it's made from PvC.  Mouth pieces range from $20 to $800 or more
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
I mean if you want to learn a 2 is the easiest to find and start with
3:51 AM
But unless his instructions are really specific you'll have to go through 100 pipes, also soprano sax is one of the hardest ones

Ideally you should start on an alto or tenor
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Or even a clarinet
 If the sound holes aren't perfect it just gets even harder
As a beginner using cheaper equipment, honestly probably not.  Also it will necessarily be more clarinet like anyways cause you'll be using small finger holes, saxes use mechanical covers for larger holes
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
One of the many parts of that sax sound is that the sound holes are too big to be plugged with a finger so this PvC pipe instrument is probably closer to a clarinet or bassoon anyways
You sent
yes. its technically a recorder, or bassoon
You sent
thats cool. I LOVE the bassoon, even more than a sax
You sent
aha, Im starting to get it
Alexander

I guess? TBH I'm not 100% sure but I have noticed that clarinet and soprano sax mouthpieces are almost the same
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
So the difference is mainly in the body material and the hole size
You sent
People are finding that PVC is surprisingly good
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Plastic is probably closer to wood than brass
You sent
It actually has a dark, dense, cool, classy sound
You sent
Ancient instrument makers literally didn't have it available
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
It probably depends on what you're going for.  I would describe that guys instrument as an alto clarinet or a soprano bassoon or something based off of my simple understanding...
You sent
soprano bassoon. pretty close
You sent
may i ask a couple more sax questions?
Alexander
Yeah, it's come a long way.  Kind of disturbing
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Of course!
You sent
BTW, the song happy birthday is in the MIXOLYDIAN scale
You sent
thats a big happy jazz scale
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
As someone though who liked compositions and would always get lazy with the details, I imagine an AI like this might be an asset for me
You sent
What are the best "basic sax beginner vids?"
You sent
If Im playing a PVC bassoon, what are the best exercises?
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Well, better sax is the most popular but the best detailed videos are by "sax comprehensive"
You sent
Do you get sharp notes with your mouth?
You sent
or is there a sharp key?
Alexander
I can only do the main note and one octave with my mouth... the real experts can hit like 5 notes with their mouth
Alexander
Don't worry about mouthpiece harmonics too start you gotta be able to do the basics first
Alexander
Some black guy made a channel, sax comprehensive, it's got super detailed mouth diagrams etc
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Blacks love sax for some reason, maybe it's their lip shape ðŸ¤”
You sent
aha... I get it. Isn't there an exercise where you play a whole song with the mouthpiece?
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Yeah if you're some kind of sax god
You sent
so what are the absolute basics?
You sent
major scale
You sent
happy birthday?
Alexander
I have gotten my tone to where I like it and can only do like 2 notes on the mouthpiece well
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Yeah just pick any easy song you like
You sent
what is the hardest thing?
Alexander
Also use a phone tuner and make sure your notes are consistent with each other
Alexander
If you are outd tune to begin with that's common.  I could only hold soprano sax embouchure for like 15 minutes when I started and was flat by a whole note
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
The hardest thing is patience which is why I'm concerned that a PVC pipe instrument is not a good start ðŸ˜‰
You sent
aha. cool, im noting all this in a document, cheers
You sent
I am just fanatically exciting about affordable instruments
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
You have to physically build up your mouth muscles especially with smaller mouthpieces which are harder
You sent
ok, smaller = harder, noted
You sent
So what kind of mouthpiece should I buy?
Alexander
At 1-2 months I was in tune but my mouth would fail me at like 20-25 minutes of playing
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
After like 6 months I like tone but it fails after like 40 minutes
You sent
wow that is harsher than I thought
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Depends on the PVC pipe you're using but use the largest one that will fit your setup
You sent
So, if I just pick three bluesy notes, and work on tone, is that a good idea?
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Well actually I'd recommend alto because I had a cheap instrument with a tenor mouthpiece and it sounded bizarre
You sent
ok, large mouthpiece is good. noted.
You sent
OK, that was my question...
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
It's probably possible for too large compared to the pipe... but soprano is really hard to begin with
You sent
what does it sound like at first, like a first day beginner?
You sent
Like pig squealing, squeaking, honking?
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
So I'd recommend alto, it's in-between the two
You sent
i will prolly go with alto
Alexander
Honking is definitely a thing yeah
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
You need a ligature too btw
You sent
So what do I need to buy in the shop? I dont want to get this wrong
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Ligature holds the eyes to the mouthpiece.  You wrap your lips around it (check those YouTube videos) and blow so that the Reed vibrates against the mouthpiece.  If it's just the mouthpiece it'll squeak
You sent
Large mouthpiece, 2.5 reed... and a ligature?
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Also mouthpiece, 2 Reed and an alto mouthpiece ligature
You sent
so that is three things?
Alexander
Don't try to learn on 2.5 yourouth won't handle it for more than a few minutes
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Mouth*
You sent
ok, so... 2
You sent
1) Beginner large alto mouthpiece. 2) 2 reed. 3) alto ligature.
Alexander
Honestly I would try to find a cheap used alro somewhere.  Half the notes will have air leaks but you should be able to know if the problem is you or your PVC pipe then...
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
There's no such thing as a large alto, sorry... just alto
You sent
I literally don't have the cash
You sent
budget instruments are exciting to me.
You sent
I will deal with the bumps in the road. don't worry
You sent
when I was a kid... my parents told me they couldn't buy me a sax, cos it was 800 pounds
You sent
and I was really sad about that
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Yeah that's a problem... one other idea might be to get an extra pipe with no holes.  If you get a squeak from just the mouthpiece, then some kinda honk from a straight pipe (I have no idea what it'd sound like) then you can compare that to a drilled pipe
You sent
So I want to show some kid that he can start for 20 bucks
You sent
Even if its super hard
Alexander
I almost played sax as a kid but then I saw the guy clean it out and it had like a gallon of spit in it and I changed my mind
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
But in hindsight I realized that guy was unusually spitty
You sent
haha
You sent
spit valves gross me out too
You sent
But no spit valve would be even grosser
You sent
why should I try with a no hole pvc pipe. As a comparison. I can half see your logic...
You sent
What am I aiming for? (PVC is cheap, so I will try what you said)
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Just so that you have a frame of reference... so much might go wrong with a home made instrument
You sent
sure, I get it
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Like, the no hope pipe might not work well either but more references means better troubleshooting
You sent
the luthier I am working with is pretty talented. he's a real hardware genius, TBH
You sent
aha, I get it
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Also is this design one pipe or multiple pipes
You sent
So with no holes, you're expecting...? just a honk... OK, I see your logic
You sent
One pipe
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Some kind of low note is my guess
You sent
multiple pipe looks lame, is more difficult, and more could go wrong
Alexander
But like, then you can compare it to how you're plugging the holesnwith your fingers
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Ya one pipe is probably better
You sent
I cued this vid. 2 mins if you have the time. He plays beautifully.

Ttyl!
You sent
thanks for all your time today. You gave me a lot to think about, and I avoided some mistakes.
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
You sent
If yuou have time to tell me, expected total cost for mouthpiece, reed and ligature, that'd be cool. but if not, no worries
You sent
Sleep well!!!!
You sent
Nashville will be good to you. I can feel it strongly.
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Thanks ttyl
You sent
take care
Alexander
A Yamaha 4C is the standard and are like $25 but you might find cheaper brands in Taiwan.  Ligatures can be real cheap like $5 $10 tops.  Reeds are all the same unless you drop tons of cash
Alexander
Alexander Wortham
Like you can buy plastic coated bamboo reeds from Japan or weird synthetic French stuff but every other Reed sounds the same to me and most people just use normal reeds, even at professional levels of playing
8:19 AM
You sent
aha. Got it. Cheers
You sent
Copying all of this to a doc.
You sent
I guess I'll go with Yamaha. No point in saving cash on some lame knock off. 4C, got it
