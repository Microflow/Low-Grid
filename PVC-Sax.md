# Measurements

# Drill bit hole size from the above video.

### NOTE: There are a couple of typos, which I preserved, because I wasn't sure exactly what he was saying..

- The pipe is 19 1/2 inches long,

- The diameter of the pipe is 1 inch, 

- There is a 1 1/2 distance from the center of the first top three holes 
so each doubt that you make for your first three holes should be 1 1/2 inch apart. 

- NOTE: What did he mistype with "doubt"?

- NOTE: FIRST THREE HOLES 1 and 1/2 inch apart.

- Hole 4 should be 1 and 5/8 inches from the 3rd hole, 
the 5th hole should be the same, along with the 6th hole. 

- NOTE: LAST THREE HOLES 1 and 5/8 inches apart?

### Drill bit hole size: 

- The first three holes, 1/2 drill bit, 
- The fourth hole, 3/8 drillbit 
- Hole 5 and 6, 1/2 drillbit.

## Materials: 

- The pipe is made from a piece of PVC 
- The saxophone mouthpiece I bought from a music store
- The rubber cap  holding on the saxophone mouthpiece can be bought from any hardware store
- The copper elbow tubing goes into the saxophone mouthpiece
